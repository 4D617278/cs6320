<s> I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott . We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators , which are used all night long . When speaking to the front desk , I was told that they were simply <unknown> my request for an upper floor , which I had requested for a better view . I am looking at a brick wall , and getting no sleep . He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the <unknown> floor , and were aware of the noise problem . Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked ? A request for an upper floor does not <unknown> <unknown> someone on the <unknown> floor and using that request to <unknown> this . If you <unknown> to stay here , request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator ! I spoke at <unknown> when booking my two rooms about my <unknown> . This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they <unknown> would not complain . <stop>
<s> I LOVED this hotel . The room was so chic and trendy , the bed was comfortable , great slippers and robes . I love the <unknown> 's bath products in the bathroom . We went during my birthday weekend , and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room . We got a great deal on a junior suite from Travelzoo , but when we tried to take another trip to Chicago , the deal was gone . I really recommend the hotel . I LOVED it . The ONLY problem we had was with the David Burke <unknown> . The service was horrible , they switched our order with the table next to our 's and the only compensation was they took off a $ 7 side dish we ordered ( and they were nice enough to NOT charge us for the other side dish we <unknown> N'T get ) . DO N'T go there . Go to the <unknown> 's <unknown> the street . But stay at the James . ( <unknown> its not a <unknown> hotel like the website <unknown> its at least 4-star ) <stop>
<s> The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago has <unknown> my favorite hotel . I 've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience . As you might have <unknown> - it has a super Rock & <unknown> theme , with some music <unknown> in the lobby and on each floor 's elevator lobby . The rooms all have large photo <unknown> that are <unknown> to different <unknown> . You can request being on the floor of your favorite <unknown> ( like <unknown> , <unknown> , etc ... ) The rooms are <unknown> . Well appointed . <unknown> Comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and <unknown> pillows . The large TV has a cool sound system that <unknown> up the <unknown> experience . There 's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar . I 've always had a room with big windows and a view down Michigan Ave ( the hotel sits right on Michigan - a block from the <unknown> ) . The bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures <unknown> a great design ... some of the showers have windows in side of them ( you can shower AND enjoy the view down Michigan ! ) or close the <unknown> <unknown> . I 've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here ... front desk , doorman , etc are all great . There 's a lobby bar that still <unknown> <unknown> and has nice <unknown> . <unknown> screen TV to catch the <unknown> <unknown> , too . Of course , Rock & <unknown> music <unknown> thru the place . You can stay at a `` plain '' hotel anywhere ... but this is a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> HOTEL that you 'll want to return back to . If I had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight . My daily car parking rate was close to $ 50 per night , which I 'm <unknown> to say is about the going rate in the loop . Stay here . Be cool . <stop>
<s> We also just returned from a <unknown> weekend in Chicago . I booked the Ambassador East because of its great rate , $ <unknown> with my <unknown> card and we were delighted . Yes , the rooms show some signs of wear , but the <unknown> and charm far make up for it . This was such a pleasant change from the sleek , modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels . We became members of the I preferred program and were <unknown> <unknown> for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in . We had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom . We had wonderful food at the Pump Room which is classic . Our <unknown> there was so <unknown> served , I 'd love to have some right now ! The location was great . Had it been normal winter weather , we could have easily walked to Michigan Avenue for shopping , but due to the <unknown> 20 degree <unknown> , we <unknown> for a cab which was less than a $ <unknown> fare . We also enjoyed a glass of wine around the <unknown> in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not <unknown> at all . We would definitely stay here again ! <stop>
<s> I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels I 've stayed at the . The receptionist up front was a <unknown> , <unknown> teenager or post teenager . You can get better service from a waiter or <unknown> at a <unknown> . The room was dirty , stains on the carpet , the showerhead was moldy and <unknown> , the doors of the bathroom and main door all had <unknown> and <unknown> . The towels had a horrible <unknown> . The hotel is very <unknown> , so we were near a construction <unknown> so , I would plan on <unknown> up at 6 : am if you choose the Talbott . The next day , I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room . That room though was right by the elevator and it was <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> of the elevator which just would never stop . I asked for late checkout at <unknown> and the receptionist <unknown> stating that we would be charged for a half day , if were not out by noon . I had to speak to the manager who gave us till <unknown> . <unknown> stay away from this hotel , I think a Holiday Inn would be better . <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <stop>
<s> My wife and I came to spend the weekend in downtown Chicago for shopping and we found this Conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that does n't make you feel lost in the <unknown> world . We have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past . Our Suite has view on Michigan <unknown> with a bit of the Lake at the end . Staff was very professional , pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable . Internet is free <unknown> the rooms and I am making my review from there . <stop>
<s> We arrived and thought for $ <unknown> a night , it would be a decent place . Good reviews , etc ... We arrived to find that the website pictures were <unknown> . The hotel lounge was a `` room '' , it was really odd and very dark . The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking . <unknown> something you 'd find on a street . To top it all off we woke up after night # 2 to find that bed bugs had <unknown> us . My husband and I were both bitten . I was bitten <unknown> more than my husband . My <unknown> were covered with bites . I was on <unknown> and <unknown> for over a week . I immediately came home and <unknown> all our clothes . There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it . The bathroom floor was also <unknown> up by the tub . The view in room # <unknown> is of a roof . Not good . The stay was VERY disappointing . The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor . <stop>
<s> <unknown> returned from a <unknown> stay at Ambassador East Hotel . Was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in Chicago . <unknown> was <unknown> . If you would like a quiet , comfortable hotel in a great area - this is it . While some of the furnishings show some signs of their age , it does not <unknown> from the elegant style of the rooms and <unknown> to the comfortable and <unknown> feeling . Found staff to be friendly and helpful . We will be return guests many times in the future for sure . <stop>
<s> After <unknown> some important <unknown> in the room , I called and asked for the lost and found department ... <unknown> <unknown> over the course of a week . <unknown> I had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then <unknown> . Finally , a <unknown> friendly operator <unknown> me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes , It never happened . So <unknown> this place because after they rip you off once they 'll keep doing it later . They can not be <unknown> at their word <stop>
<s> <unknown> : <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ! ! ! The room was dirty , the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on . The elevators were <unknown> terrible they made me <unknown> every time i went on it . They <unknown> pasta night and they put out a bowl of <unknown> and <unknown> and i couple of <unknown> well you get what you pay for . What was worse is the <unknown> must of had bad <unknown> in it because my family got so <unknown> . The one thing that was nice was the location which was right by <unknown> <unknown> . The second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer . DO NOT STAY <unknown> <stop>
<s> I took the wife and kids to Chicago for one last <unknown> before school started back up . When I checked in , the staff was very attentive , I showed a little <unknown> for the friendly attitude ( small tip ) and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar ! I did n't get the `` Priceline '' <unknown> and it paid off for all involved . The air and water show was <unknown> on the lake front , and we had <unknown> flying over our room . The kids thought it was great . That night we had a great view of the <unknown> at Navy Pier . The Sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason . The conceirge was very knowledgeable and very friendly . It was one of the best times we ever had in Chicago . <stop>
<s> While overall a decent property , the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel . I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights , checking out on Monday , March <unknown> . <unknown> after leaving the hotel and <unknown> my car from the valet , my <unknown> and I noticed a large <unknown> on the <unknown> of the car that was n't present upon checking in . We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay . I called the hotel <unknown> two hours after checking out and was <unknown> to speak with the garage manager at Park One ( their valet company ) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to <unknown> that the car was <unknown> upon arrival , and was <unknown> upon departure from the garage . The garage manager , <unknown> <unknown> , did n't call back until I had an email <unknown> with the general manager of the hotel , <unknown> <unknown> . When he finally got back to me , the garage manager stated that he would file an `` incident report '' and claim with his <unknown> company , <unknown> , which would eventually <unknown> the claim because garage staff would n't <unknown> fault or <unknown> , nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or <unknown> the garage , which could have <unknown> that the <unknown> was n't present upon check-in , but was at check-out . Their <unknown> representative even told me that the garage does not have <unknown> at that location , <unknown> the garage manager . In the end , this Kimpton <unknown> guest got stuck with a $ <unknown> bill for parking at this Kimpton property : an almost $ <unknown> paint <unknown> on top of a $ <unknown> day parking fee , rental car <unknown> , several hours of lost time in <unknown> with the issue , and one <unknown> <unknown> . In the end , do NOT <unknown> the <unknown> or staff at this hotel , and take your business elsewhere if at all possible . <stop>
<s> This hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means . <unknown> service . Hotel ran out of hot water by <unknown> <unknown> . <unknown> were very slow , waited 10 minutes on any given event . Red line <unknown> ran every 10 minutes <unknown> city streets and you can hear the <unknown> in your room from them but it <unknown> keep you <unknown> at night . Used my stay toward <unknown> <unknown> bonus points . Bar was <unknown> One cup coffee service was awful . No free wireless and no free <unknown> channels . <unknown> was 25 bucks a day to use . With <unknown> : <unknown> <unknown> got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you <unknown> ? ... . Location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to <unknown> the <unknown> . <stop>
<s> We went with the great reviews on <unknown> . The location , rooms , amenities and price via Expedia were good . My complaint is the poor service at every <unknown> - the check-in was slow ( even at <unknown> ) , the concierge ( <unknown> ) was <unknown> , staff were generally rude . Also there was some sort of <unknown> <unknown> under the bed which <unknown> all night - we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning . Finally , just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and <unknown> at <unknown> with <unknown> that <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> they <unknown> ! ! ! Would I stay here again ? - maybe if I got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby . <stop>
<s> My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and loved it . Our stay was booked for us by <unknown> <unknown> when we booked our flights from London to Chicago . We were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the Hilton brand name . In the event we found that the <unknown> knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel . On <unknown> we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient . The <unknown> of the hotel is <unknown> and looks like has been <unknown> to <unknown> the decor as it would have been when it was built . The room we were given was a good size with 1 <unknown> bed which was particularly comfortable . The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby . The first night we ate at the hotel 's own <unknown> restaurant ( The Lockwood ) which did not <unknown> . The breakfasts are also served in this restaurant . We had the buffet both <unknown> and these were good value for the quality offered . <unknown> we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful . A nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next <unknown> the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving . A member of staff <unknown> the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to <unknown> us find the car when it did arrive . Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money . <stop>
<s> Just got back from a 10 day visit to Chicago . For the rate of $ <unknown> per night , it was extremely good value . <unknown> staff were efficient , courteous and very friendly . I was given a room on the top floor ( 32nd floor ) facing the lake and the John Hancock Tower . The rooms were large and very comfortable . <unknown> <unknown> Service were efficient and <unknown> . Bathroom amenities were very good and replaced daily . This is definitely my first choice for a Hotel in Chicago . It is also very close to all the shops , restaurants and the subway . <stop>
<s> Ambassador East is an awesome hotel ! ! ! <unknown> that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel . My family stayed at the Ambassador for two nights in a suite . Very clean room with great space . The best part of the Ambassador is not the rooms though . The staff was extremely courteous , especially the concierge . If you stay here you have to go to the Pump Room . The restaurant is full of <unknown> , the staff is great , and the food is excellent . Great atmosphere and music . <stop>
<s> We recently <unknown> our second stay at the Fairmont Chicago . The check-in process was quick and <unknown> but the front desk staff was almost <unknown> in the whole <unknown> . That is fine when I am traveling on business , but on leisure trips I would appreciate a <unknown> greeting . The hotel was <unknown> a convention at the same time as our stay , but other than seeing some <unknown> in the lobby , we would n't have noticed . This is probably due to the <unknown> of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 <unknown> elevators . We stayed in a <unknown> Suite so we had a large room with a great view of Millenium Park . The <unknown> was well appointed with a sofa , coffee table , desk , mini-bar with sink and coffee maker , and dining area . The bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard Fairmont room , but maybe slightly larger . The bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard Fairmont room , and once again , possibly slightly larger . The upscale modern decor is pleasing but not <unknown> luxurious , and several small touches such as a <unknown> <unknown> station ( with extra <unknown> <unknown> ) , are <unknown> throughout . We booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly <unknown> . The hotel restaurant , Aria , could n't find our reservation but they <unknown> new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us . They had no problem seating us and the dinner ( both food and service ) was lovely . <unknown> complaints : The pillows could be better . I 'm not sure if they remembered our preference for <unknown> bedding from our last visit , but seriously , these things barely felt like pillows . I 'll <unknown> through some <unknown> if I can get better <unknown> <unknown> . Also , the valet parking <unknown> seem <unknown> <unknown> to take your car ( and charge you $ <unknown> ) . And as I mentioned above , the front desk experience could be <unknown> . Best feature : After our first stay , I gave a brief review in the comments <unknown> of the Fairmont <unknown> 's Club ( membership is free ) website . I received a phone call from the Director of Rooms the same day asking to <unknown> our experience . After this stay , I left a comment essentially <unknown> the hotel staff for a great stay , but still received a warm , friendly phone call from the Director of Rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay . <unknown> to the Fairmont for taking its customers seriously , and for that , they 've won my <unknown> . <stop>
<s> Did n't get the room we were promised . <unknown> of room we had reserved ( 2 queens ) `` was n't available . they then <unknown> 3 <unknown> <unknown> into 2 <unknown> and a <unknown> bed . Had to <unknown> furniture on top of tables to get it in ! Very <unknown> ! ! Will not return , will not recommend . Will tell people going to Chicago to NOT stay in your hotel . When I next visit <unknown> <unknown> , I <unknown> to stop at your world <unknown> to tell them what I think of the Chicago facility . <stop>
<s> I thought the Swissotel was a great hotel . The rooms were very spacious and clean , especially for downtown Chicago standards . Most importantly , the rooms were quiet . I never heard people in the hallways when I was trying to sleep . The only downside was that the beds were not anything special . <unknown> , like all hotels in Chicago , this hotel <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price . However , if you are aware of that prior to arrival , its not a big deal ( ie finding a different place to park the car , <unknown> our own snacks for the room ) . It would be nice though if hotels such as the Swissotel had a <unknown> in the room for guest use . Staff was very helpful . <unknown> instantly got cabs upon request , and the front desk was efficient and helpful . Overall , if I can get a good rate again , I 'll stay at the Swissotel the next time I am in Chicago . <stop>
<s> <unknown> a nice place to stay ... I had a great deal for the room , and was impressed with the quality . Hotel staff was very helpful ; they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes . Negative : It is frustrating that <unknown> you do not have free internet in most hotels and it 's the same here ; you have to pay for the internet . Negative : <unknown> on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone , or them shower . <stop>
<s> After staying at the Sheraton <unknown> <unknown> Hotel in <unknown> , I was expecting a similar experience at the Chicago Sheraton . I had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a <unknown> experience . Unfortunately , my expectations were not met . For the past 3 years I stayed at the Palmer House in the Loop , but thought I 'd try a more modern hotel . <unknown> - location by the Chicago River , two blocks from Michigan Avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work <unknown> - buffet breakfast <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> toast <unknown> - check-in assigned me to a city view room when I had <unknown> for a river view room - river view was good , but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was <unknown> : <unknown> <unknown> ; worn <unknown> fixtures ; only 2 <unknown> of towels provided - guest room was small : only one soft chair provided - guest room doors <unknown> <unknown> throughout the floor hallway - 7 to 8 block walk to <unknown> <unknown> - concierge could n't explain how to get to the <unknown> <unknown> , nor print a <unknown> of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get Starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the <unknown> Cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing <unknown> delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were <unknown> at the <unknown> Cafe where boarding passes can be printed <stop>
<s> The concierge was so helpful . <unknown> hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all <unknown> out to be wonderful . They even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could <unknown> <unknown> or immediate seating 's . Loved the health club at the back of the hotel . By <unknown> the <unknown> club , it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities . The rooms were large , updated and had views looking out in 3 directions . The coffee maker in the room was exceptional . Location is great for getting mostly anywhere . Parking is overpriced so we took our <unknown> to the underground Millennium <unknown> that was only $ <unknown> per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel . <stop>
<s> Booked via Priceline.com for a weekend getaway and got the room for $ 75 per night . When we arrived via Midway we took the <unknown> Line to within a block of the hotel for just $ 2 . Hotel easy to find . Never felt uncomfortable with the <unknown> . <unknown> very few homeless or <unknown> . <unknown> all over the place . Great location and hotel is about a $ <unknown> $ 6 cab ride from most major <unknown> . Hotel is almost <unknown> with <unknown> , but it 's not that different from a <unknown> <unknown> decor . It was not annoying decor by any means . Check in was <unknown> and the service was great ! <unknown> NO noise whatsoever ... the <unknown> of `` thin walls '' are <unknown> <unknown> . The walls are all concrete and <unknown> ... we heard <unknown> both nights we were there ! Highly recommend this hotel ! Rooms are small but not crowded for two people ... they are old style hotel <unknown> classic <stop>
<s> I am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I <unknown> <unknown> . The front desk staff were brief and one of them was <unknown> with her friend ( <unknown> ) as I checked in ( VERY unprofessional ) . The room she offered me was on a <unknown> ' floor ( 5th ... . <unknown> ) and when I checked in there was a big bag of <unknown> left behind by the previous guest on the window <unknown> and some of the previous guests hair in the <unknown> ... .I was <unknown> . Called down and had them <unknown> the room ; they made no offer to <unknown> or upgrade ... not even a bottle of wine . The front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room ( like I have time for that ) . <unknown> as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In <unknown> member ( <unknown> they 've done away with the amenities ... you just get a free <unknown> from the mini bar ) . <stop>
<s> We stayed in a king suite at the Hotel Allegro over Memorial Day weekend . We paid $ <unknown> , and it was definitely a bargain . The suite was huge - living room with a couch , two chairs , desk ; large bathroom ; bedroom ; two closets . The room had recently been renovated , and was very clean . Comfortable bed , friendly staff , great location ( near the train and bus ) , evening wine reception and morning coffee provided . While the Allegro is n't a <unknown> hotel , it is a great place for the money . ( <unknown> : a friend stayed in a <unknown> room , and reported that it was very small . <unknown> if possible ) . <stop>
<s> My husband attended a conference in Chicago for the weekend of June <unknown> and I decided to <unknown> along for the shopping ! We <unknown> into O'Hare and took a cab to the hotel , cost about $ 30 . <unknown> from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful . We had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction , but we were hardly in the room so it did n't bother us . We were also never <unknown> due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper . The room was clean and spacious enough for us . The bed is very comfy . We ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all <unknown> were great . The location of this hotel is perfect . You are about 1 & 1/2 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Hancock tower . Ca n't beat that ! There is also an <unknown> pet store called <unknown> In The City across from the hotel ! I brought our dog back a couple of <unknown> ! They are very nice as well . All in all , no complaints . The hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting . The staff is always friendly and the location is superb . It 's a safe <unknown> walked around by myself and felt fine . We would definitely return . <stop>
<s> I booked this hotel for $ 75 on Hotwire with <unknown> expectations for one night . <unknown> blown away . Arrived on a Sunday night . Gave car to valet ( $ <unknown> ) . Lobby was a <unknown> people watching scene with <unknown> music . Check-in was smooth and easy . I asked for an upgrade and was told no free <unknown> to 3rd party <unknown> . <unknown> to suite was available at a cost . I <unknown> since only 1 night stay . I asked for a nice , quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine . <unknown> room <unknown> . Room was huge with 2 beds . <unknown> like 400 <unknown> feet . <unknown> renovated last year . <unknown> hop told me some rooms are very small so I totally <unknown> out ! Service from start to finish was top notch . Everyone had a smile on their face . Always spoke with great <unknown> and made us feel welcome . <unknown> room service at <unknown> PM . Arrived in 1/2 hour . food was <unknown> . Had <unknown> in Lockwood for breakfast . Very good food and very good service . <unknown> coffee . Hotel is right on State Street shopping . <unknown> - Rooms on floors 15 and below were renovated last year . <unknown> were done 5 years ago . For the price , it was a great bargain ! Only complaint is bathroom is small . <stop>
<s> Even though the reviews of this hotel are very good , the only good thing about it is the Location , which is <unknown> . aside from that , there are only 2 elevators , so there is <unknown> a wait to get in . they also seem to have <unknown> staff so getting your luggage , room service , etc <unknown> forever . even if you arrive in a cab , there is no space to <unknown> so you have to block the street while you <unknown> , the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a <unknown> . all in all , there are much better options in Chicago <stop>
<s> <unknown> what other are saying , this was one , if not the best Hotel stay in Chicago I have had . I travel to the <unknown> City about three times a year for pleasure and The James rates up with the best . I was upgraded and the staff made the stay worth my special weekend visit . I do n't believe you will be disapointed . <stop>
<s> We experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel on the Magnificent Mile . We never received a return call from <unknown> Manager <unknown> <unknown> after several <unknown> . We will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word . We also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel . <stop>
<s> We travel to Chicago <unknown> and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago . We booked a <unknown> room on the weekend of the half <unknown> . The place was busy , but the staff certainly found time for each <unknown> guest . The room was nice and just what we expected . The pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel . The location was great as we were taking in the <unknown> <unknown> game on a <unknown> night and a <unknown> game on a <unknown> night . We would certainly stay there again and would <unknown> it to others . Great quality even at the regular room price . <stop>
<s> We recently stayed at the hotel <unknown> in chicago <unknown> , while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here . I payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for <unknown> ( $ <unknown> ) the next day my debit card was charged $ 200 clearly this had to be a mistake ... i called the hotel manager who was the <unknown> person i have ever <unknown> with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account , <unknown> , <unknown> # and <unknown> <unknown> and he could call my bank and take care of it . <unknown> i am <unknown> enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged . I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already <unknown> my account and that they were <unknown> and it was clearly my mistake . I then <unknown> them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already <unknown> my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me . So for your bank <unknown> <unknown> do not stay here they are many other options in chicago <stop>
<s> From the moment I <unknown> up to the front entrance my luxury service began ! I enjoyed every minute @ the fairmont ! The King room was spacious and the decor chic ! The coffee maker was the <unknown> and the bathroom is huge ! I really like the separate shower , tub , and separate door for the toilet . The <unknown> and cheese spread at <unknown> so yummy . Before the fairmont the W hotel was my favorite chain of hotels to stay at . <stop>
<s> This a great property , excellent location and wonderful staff . Everyone was very accommodating and polite . The room I had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite , with a living area and a bedroom . The living room was spacious , with a plasma TV , a desk and a couch . The beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality . In the closed they placed an umbrella , which came in handy , it <unknown> the whole time I was in Chicago . The internet connection is $ <unknown> . Great place , I will return for sure . <stop>
<s> I can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a <unknown> . 1 . There was a huge <unknown> hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor . I <unknown> you not . How can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been <unknown> by a giant <unknown> ? 2 . The furniture was severely <unknown> . Ok . I dont mind <unknown> furniture if I am <unknown> it in my <unknown> 's apartment . But for <unknown> a night , I want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff <unknown> from a <unknown> drive 3 . The receptionist while I was checking in was super <unknown> . I know it was late but <unknown> that sort of your job ? Not everything was horribly bad though . The one star is for the bathroom that was super clean . I do not recommend this place at all . <stop>
<s> I actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price ! It was a lovely hotel , beautifully appointed , walking distance from the places we wanted to go . We would highly recommend the Fairmont . <stop>
<s> The hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly , however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking . Our air conditioning did n't seem to be working well , but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually ... cool off . Our first night was <unknown> by a phone call at one <unknown> That was a <unknown> , it happened 4 times . By this time we realized that the air was not working again , so after <unknown> with the <unknown> it did kick on . The next morning I mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone , but did n't think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working . After being out seeing the sites of Chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to <unknown> in a cool room before going to a show . Our room was 78 degrees , I called and <unknown> did come to check . After <unknown> that the unit needed a <unknown> it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out . I feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel . Also was very surprised that WiFi was not a free service ! ! We will not be staying at the Hilton on our next trip to Chicago . <stop>
<s> I was very happy with my stay at the Knickerbocker . The room were nice , and the staff was excellent . I was able to stay here for $ 80 per night thru Priceline . That was an incredible bargain in my opinion .. this hotel is very nice . It has an excellent location ... just off of Michigan Ave. All of the best shopping in Chicago can be found right around the corner . It 's a great location ... very close to many great attractions . If there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool , but I think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in Chicago , I would definately recommend this place ... <unknown> I will be able to stay there again in the future . <stop>
<s> My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in <unknown> . We decided to <unknown> our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different <unknown> and areas of Chicago in a week . I 'll start out by saying that this was a great experience . At check-in , I <unknown> that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite . The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile . It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush . Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed . Our suite ( on the 3rd floor ) had two very large closets , a large `` living room '' and a large bedroom . The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough . If I would have payed full price for this suite , I probably would have given it a rating of 4 , but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here , I decided to give it a five . It is also worth <unknown> that the concierge was very helpful . My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant , but we were not very impressed . We found the food and service mediocre . The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when <unknown> used to eat there back in the day , but not <unknown> . Although we were <unknown> by the Pump Room , the staff were kind enough to seat us in the `` <unknown> <unknown> '' which was back in a corner and <unknown> by curtains . That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here . The Ambassador East is an older hotel , but it is in a charming older neighborhood . The staff 's <unknown> and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me . When we are in Chicago again , we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again . <stop>
<s> What a wonderful experience , super great , helpful , friendly staff . <unknown> at the front desk made sure my <unknown> birthday would be great . Our room was beautiful . <unknown> suggested we go to <unknown> for <unknown> choice , make the reservation for us .

<s> This hotel was very beautiful . I went with a group of 4 friends and we had a <unknown> . It was very centrally located and was close to all <unknown> of transportation . The <unknown> breakfast was magnificent ! I did n't see much of the staff but all of the men at the front door were extremely helpful . <stop>
<s> so my <unknown> <unknown> me out under the <unknown> of dinner at the <unknown> <unknown> , upon arrival he <unknown> me his boys are watching the game in a suite upstairs and want to say <unknown> ... we arrive at the <unknown> floor and my oh my ! ! ! <unknown> ! ! ! <unknown> and <unknown> THIS is something to be <unknown> ... spacious and roomy , yet warm , cozy and inviting ... great bed , comfortable furniture , great 42 inch <unknown> , and the views are <unknown> ... my only complaint ? a shower should have a door to keep the heat <unknown> ... other than that no complaints , room service was great , morning coffee was <unknown> ... overall a fabulous experience ! ! ! <stop>
<s> The Conrad has all the right stuff - great bedding , <unknown> <unknown> , beautiful lobby , etc . However , they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to <unknown> . When I checked in , I went to get a glass of wine from the minibar , only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm . I called for help and was <unknown> told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it . In the meantime , I said , great , but what about a cold drink ? They <unknown> to send me 1 glass of wine via room service , without asking me if this would be okay . I paid $ 25 for 1 glass of wine . The minibar bottle would 've given me 2 glasses for about $ <unknown> . Nothing was said to me about this <unknown> difference . When I called to complain , I was made to feel cheap . To me , it was not the money , it was the <unknown> . The next morning , my bill showed that I had eaten something out of the minibar . I had not . I called , and they said that the <unknown> <unknown> in the minibar must have <unknown> something ( <unknown> - when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its <unknown> to fix it ) , and they took the charge off . They also took $ 10 off my room service bill , but I was still annoyed that nobody <unknown> to apologize or acknowledge the fact that I was <unknown> . Also , when they fixed the minibar fridge , they did not replace anything in it . The guy said , it 'll take a while for things to cool down . Oh , really ? How about the warm beer , that was once cold , that will now taste disgusting ? I guess they 're saving that for the next person who <unknown> into my room and has no idea . Another <unknown> was that the <unknown> mirror in our bathroom did not work . When I <unknown> it in , it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off , and then it never would come on . It seems that the Conrad <unknown> it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful , without <unknown> about each customer 's experience . I do n't think they go into the rooms and check them out . And their <unknown> <stop>
<s> Having had a great stay at the Monaco last <unknown> with friends , I was disappointed ( <unknown> ) to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they did n't have our <unknown> made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for <unknown> . eve . <unknown> they immediately took <unknown> for their mistake by doing the following : found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it ! Gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there . <unknown> for our valet parking $ <unknown> that eve . So <unknown> when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve ( when they did have room ) , we said yes . When we returned , they gave us a corner suite with <unknown> tub for our $ <unknown> <unknown> rate ! Now that 's what I call a <unknown> ! ! <stop>
<s> I have been 4 times in Chicago , and I have stayed in 4 different Hotels : This has been for much the very best option . The lobby , the warm of the receptionist , the room , the hotel is very good . It is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and there 's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel . If you like to travel with style this could be a very good option . <stop>
<s> <unknown> 's a little late , but ... My husband & I first stayed at the Amalfi in <unknown> totally based on reviews I read on this website . We were totally <unknown> ! ! Loved the location , the room , the Aveda bath products , but most of all loved the evening reception & breakfast on our floor . I returned to Chicago with 3 girlfriends in <unknown> and booked us in a suite at the Amalfi . It was great - room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased ! Will stay next time I 'm in Chicago too ! ! <unknown> . They honor a <unknown> rate ! ! ! ! <stop>
<s> We loved the Talbott . The location was fabulous ... very close to the shopping . The hotel is smaller , but the rooms are very nice . They are very spacious and are able to be <unknown> to sleep well . Also , the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in . I might also add that our room at queen beds . The staff is all friendly and <unknown> them themselves out for you . The hotel has a cute <unknown> eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers , etc . It looks like a scene out of Europe . I would highly recommend the hotel . We were there with our daughters ; <unknown> 10 and 13 . <stop>
<s> We arrived at the Omni on 2nd September for a 6 day stay . I took <unknown> when I left the <unknown> after travelling from <unknown> so I saw more of the room than I anticipated . I could n't go out for 4 days . The room was spacious and clean . The bed was extremely comfortable . The bathroom was large and very clean . What more could you ask . We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested . I managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace ( outside the gym ) Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit <unknown> . A few <unknown> on a concrete floor . There was also noise from an air conditioning unit . It could do with a bit of <unknown> up . What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing , it has something for everyone . Would I go back to the Omni ? yes I would . <stop>
<s> Stayed at the InterContinental for an entire week on business and for the most part a very elegant , convenient visit . Stayed in the historic tower . Very nice rooms , great view , attentive staff , convenient location just north of the Tribune Tower & the river , and nice fitness club at $ 16 for the entire stay . The only downside is I could n't get over the feeling that I was being <unknown> & <unknown> : $ 10 a day for Wi-Fi , $ 6 bottles of water in the room , $ <unknown> <unknown> of wine in the fridge , <unknown> multiple staff for <unknown> the same bags , etc . Their <unknown> restaurant Zest is <unknown> <unknown> though I 'm not sure why . Within a 5 minute walk there are plenty of great restaurants with much better food than Zest . But , next time I need to be near the Loop I 'd stay at the InterContinental again . <stop>
<s> This was a <unknown> change from the <unknown> . I loved the location , the service and the amenities offered by this hotel . The room was charming with a window seat and a water view . The decor was unique but cheerful . Free wireless internet services were a plus here . The staff was helpful and attentive . We loved having goldfish share our room ! I would definitely stay here again . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in <unknown> and was so disappointed with everything . The room was small , the carpets in the <unknown> were <unknown> , no <unknown> in the <unknown> and view of brick walls from the windows . Not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days . It costs $ <unknown> to <unknown> to internet . If you want to use internet in the lobby , minimum charge is $ 5 per use . To use the phone in the rooms for local calls , it is $ <unknown> and then 10 <unknown> every min . Even the local calls are charged , what a rip off ! ! ! Every hotel I have stayed at offers free <unknown> breakfast , of course no such thing at this hotel . No <unknown> pool , go figure . I won this from <unknown> process at priceline , I will be <unknown> to use this service and this hotel in future . <stop>
<s> For a Hilton hotel I was very <unknown> , the rooms are incredibly small , there are no <unknown> or coffee machine for coffee or tea . <unknown> costs an arm . <unknown> side there is a Starbucks at the bottom , but only limited opening hours , the lobby is very nice . Location is decent . <stop>
<s> We were checked into a room with empty beer bottles , dirty <unknown> in the closet and <unknown> bathroom . There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints . We missed our show because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc . Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles especially when I had a child and a teenager with me she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience ! ! ! Staff was somewhat <unknown> to take request of extra blankets at night . They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets . I asked for two blanket , but they delivered one . I had to keep calling to get <unknown> . I saw a comment form from the prior guest in our room on the <unknown> desk , who had taken the trouble of <unknown> it out , but no one <unknown> it or cared for it . <unknown> . <unknown> rooms . <unknown> hear the doors all night . <unknown> items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished . I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at <unknown> rates ! ! <stop>
<s> We stayed here because of the <unknown> positive reviews on Trip Advisor and <unknown> . We might have had a one in a <unknown> experience , but we : - were served a <unknown> <unknown> ( a long <unknown> hair held a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ) ; - considered our guest room tiny ; - could not <unknown> a <unknown> , much less a body , in the tub ( we 're not <unknown> and we 're not <unknown> ) ; - <unknown> a broken air conditioner for days ( it could n't be <unknown> ) ; - experienced the <unknown> of an <unknown> broken toilet ( they fixed it that day ) . On a positive note , the tea from room service tasted delicious , employees were <unknown> and friendly , the location is great , and it 's very easy to get a taxi . In the future , I would reluctantly stay here for business . I would not stay here for pleasure . I think a <unknown> who has n't traveled much would appreciate this hotel more than a <unknown> traveler would ... as a friend said to me today , `` Oh , the Sofitel ? That 's the Hilton of <unknown> . '' I agree . <stop>
<s> This hotel was wonderful ! I am a college <unknown> who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it !

<s> We stayed here from <unknown> 30 to <unknown> 2 and had a wonderful time . The hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from check in to the maid staff to the <unknown> in Kitty O'Shea 's . We had a room with a king bed that was very comfortable and had very nice <unknown> pillows . You can request other types if you have a problem with <unknown> . The large flat screen TV was very nice . <unknown> products were by <unknown> & <unknown> and included shampoo , conditioner , <unknown> and <unknown> lotion . <unknown> of coffee was provided .

Good selection of beer and good <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> ! The location worked very well for us . We walked to the Art Museum and <unknown> <unknown> Blues Club is right across the street . And shopping was a breeze using the shuttle ! The cab ride to the Museum of <unknown> and <unknown> was quite far though and cost about $ 15 each way . An excellent weekend getaway ! <stop>
<s> We traveled to Chicago to visit with our daughter who <unknown> in the city . To our <unknown> what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations . <unknown> is the lobby and <unknown> are required to walk down to the <unknown> to get the one ... elevator that is working to the second floor to register . Our first room was recently renovated ... <unknown> white walls , no amenities at all . <unknown> had to <unknown> the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room . <unknown> furniture <unknown> a bed that is close to the <unknown> , a cold <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> a a <unknown> and <unknown> chair . No <unknown> , coffee maker , iron , or even a picture on the stark white walls . We asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the <unknown> floor .

<s> I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September , and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were <unknown> , but <unknown> me and my husband . For <unknown> , he got locked out of our room 2 times , once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa . The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding <unknown> , so that was <unknown> because he lost some time . The <unknown> just would stop working . Then a <unknown> blew , so we had no <unknown> while trying to get ready . It happened to me also , coming back from the spa , and I called on the hallway phone to get help . Luckily , right after that , an employee who was <unknown> walking by asked me if I had been waiting long -- as if she knew this was a problem . I said no , and she called down to check . Apparently , no one had even called Security to get me back into my room ! She had a set of keys and let me in , thank god . Then , on our wedding night , my husband wanted to order from room service . It was a little after <unknown> . We were told that room service was closed for the night -- even though all the <unknown> in the room <unknown> about `` 24 hour dining . '' That fact was never <unknown> to us when we checked in . I feel like the quality of service and amenities are <unknown> . We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off , so maybe that 's why people were n't too <unknown> in providing good service . I do n't think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again . <unknown> , the spa is great to hang out in , even if you 're not doing a massage . <stop>
<s> I try to stay at the James every time I happen to be in Chicago . There are other good choices in town , but nobody has what the James offers : superior service - <unknown> class <unknown> <unknown> - , <unknown> design and comfort with an attention to <unknown> I found only at the W in <unknown> , and what always <unknown> a <unknown> <unknown> a convenient location ... Then they get to you with small <unknown> touches that make the difference ie : I was about to take off and drive North , it was a hot July day ... one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water . A small <unknown> . <unknown> and appreciated . The management AND the staff understand what we expect and more importantly , what we need . AND they <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> that . <stop>
<s> My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker <unknown> on March <unknown> , <unknown> . We were excited about the great price we got for your 4-star hotel through priceline . Unfortunately , we were not impressed . In the past , we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown <unknown> <unknown> for <unknown> break on the <unknown> , but chose to stay closer to home this year . The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived , even though we paid for an upgrade . We asked for it to be cleaned while we were <unknown> seeing and were assured it would be looked after . Upon our return , nothing had been moved in the room to <unknown> including the tea my <unknown> had made prior to our <unknown> so I can only <unknown> , it was n't even checked as promised . We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more . They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a <unknown> and <unknown> we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice ! The curtains were dirty and <unknown> by the <unknown> , the bed <unknown> had a <unknown> stain on it , the honor <unknown> was <unknown> and dirty , too ! The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been <unknown> on - not neat and tidy at all ... <unknown> were <unknown> of <unknown> in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well . Very disappointing to say the least . I have <unknown> 's <unknown> and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds ! We were <unknown> for our upgrade - $ <unknown> but given the price of parking , taxes , and etc . at this point I would n't recommend this Hyatt to anyone . My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel . I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility . <stop>
<s> I stayed at <unknown> Chicago for business in November of <unknown> and loved it . As a <unknown> Ambassador member , they upgraded me to a beautiful junior suite with a separate living and working area and 2 bathrooms ! My upgrade was in place upon arrival and a beautiful fruit <unknown> was waiting for me on the coffee table . They even had a nice young lady <unknown> me to my room . The suite was beautifully furnished and had an Art <unknown> feel to it . The only thing I <unknown> was that I only stayed one night . I will definitely stay here on my next visit . <stop>
<s> The Sheraton is a fantastic hotel . My wife and I stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the Chicago River and Lake Michigan . The view was great . We got a corner room that also had a couch in . The hotel was just a short walk to the Navy Pier and the <unknown> Mile Shopping area . Food at the hotel was great . Service from checking in to maid service was first class . Great Hotel , Great Town , Highly recommend it . <stop>
<s> My husband and I wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago to <unknown> our anniversary , and I had been looking at the James for <unknown> because it was attached to David Burke 's Primehouse . From the moment I called to make my reservation , I knew this hotel <unknown> what customer service means to a <unknown> and a <unknown> one at that . From the <unknown> <unknown> , to the special <unknown> from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note <unknown> us for staying at the James , this staff is well <unknown> in the long lost art of customer service . The rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend . The walking distance to Michigan Av is a huge plus . From the front desk to the cleaning staff , the staff here is top notch ! And David Burke 's Primehouse is not to be missed ! <stop>
<s> The location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free <unknown> bus to Navy Pier is just beside the hotel . The room was very spacious . <unknown> of too big for a <unknown> traveler . The view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night . The bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big <unknown> . The kitchen has <unknown> <unknown> and cooking <unknown> . Some of the cooking <unknown> were a bit dirty , probably because they had not been used for <unknown> . However , the <unknown> <unknown> was very useful as I can heat up food to eat at night . You can easily walk to the magnificent mile by <unknown> across the shopping mall across the road . Do check out <unknown> <unknown> which is near the hotel that serves the delicious <unknown> dish pizza . For cheaper food , do check out the <unknown> at the shopping mall . The hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from <unknown> to <unknown> . I did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent . I will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to Chicago . <stop>
<s> I just had a conference there . They have bed bugs -- I have all these bug bites and it <unknown> like hell . Food <unknown> , we had chicken <unknown> times for lunch ( maybe my company was saving some $ ) but they should at least <unknown> them <unknown> . It looked like they did the same style chicken but change the <unknown> `` bed '' upon which it is served . For dinner , we had filet mignon and <unknown> cake . <unknown> good right ? <unknown> ! The filet mignon seems to be 1/2 the <unknown> of what I have seen and it was tough . I thought the filet mignon is suppose to be <unknown> part of the <unknown> ? ? ? ? Also , the <unknown> <unknown> was a bit too <unknown> . Finally the <unknown> were tiny and left me lacking . In asking my <unknown> , most seem to be <unknown> about the food . However , some seem to like the burger ( which they went to <unknown> ) at the <unknown> , which is a restaurant inside the hotel , just off the lobby . On the positive note , the dessert for dinner was good . Otherwise , I 'd recommend another hotel . In the meantime , when I got home , I make sure to bring EVERYTHING <unknown> to the <unknown> to <unknown> ( even <unknown> down ) . But , <unknown> , I 'm still <unknown> ' <stop>
<s> I travel a lot for business and quite <unknown> , my expectations were starting to reach new <unknown> . I usually always choose W Hotels just for the <unknown> ( of average hotels ) . The Affinia in Chicago has <unknown> my expectations and W Hotels are going to <unknown> in comparison . This hotel is one of the <unknown> I have stayed at in some time . Service was impeccable . <unknown> <unknown> staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes . The gym has new equipment with plenty of space . And such a fun <unknown> - without dark hallways and loud music . I have to thank the other <unknown> - their reviews <unknown> me to the Affinia and I was so pleased . My new `` Chicago Hotel '' . It will even <unknown> me to try the Manhattan hotels . <stop>
<s> Great beds , clean rooms , amazing bathroom , <unknown> view , wonderful service , expensive parking ( $ 40 , but it 's Chicago ) , <unknown> in and out . Very European in <unknown> and amenities , but with air conditioning ! <stop>
<s> My wife and I had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the Drake Hotel . I have stayed at the Drake before and while it is nice , it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price . We <unknown> to walk across the street and stay at the Millenium instead . I know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and I have to say they have done a great job . This place used to be the hotel you would <unknown> in when you came to Chicago on a college <unknown> ( I did ) . But that is not the case any more . This property is directly across from the Drake Hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer ( <unknown> smaller ) room and every <unknown> you would expect from a <unknown> hotel . The rooms are <unknown> decorated ( <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> screen tv ) and the bed is very comfortable . The bath is small ( no tub ) , but very clean and the shower is great . You are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when <unknown> Chicago , so the room 's size is not a big deal . ( It <unknown> well with a couple , but a family of four may be a bit cramped . ) The service was attentive and friendly and the location ca n't be beat . I would definitely stay here again , but the next time I would leave the car at home ( $ <unknown> parking is a bit <unknown> ) . <stop>
<s> Stayed <unknown> weekend . Got the 5th floor with a <unknown> view of the building next door . You have to pay extra for the pool and the ice machine was out on our floor . Parking nearby <unknown> as most of Chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car . <unknown> were <unknown> and gross . This location is <unknown> for having super sensitive <unknown> on the mini fridge , so when you barely touch it you 'll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door . Had I been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time . <stop>
<s> I 've been here for 4 days . Great location right off of miracle mile , near all major hotels , best shopping and <unknown> . Rooms very large . Hotel staff very friendly and helpful , and respond immediately . <unknown> : there frequently are homeless people ( even during <unknown> ) on <unknown> between St. <unknown> and Michigan Avenue ( the main route you walk for or all activities , and just about everything is in walking distance from here ) . At night , the street on the north side of <unknown> is dark , and it usually <unknown> strongly of several unpleasant <unknown> . The street people do not <unknown> you , although they may <unknown> as you go by . <unknown> 2 or more along the way , where they sleep on the window <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> . I would not think a woman would feel safe by <unknown> . ( I am from a large city and do not have a street people <unknown> . ) There are homeless up and down Michigan Street , but this is different as it 's a <unknown> <unknown> and no open business is along either side of the street . The entire hotel needs a lot of <unknown> work , and apparently will soon <unknown> a major renovation . For now , expect two extremely small , warm , slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm , cramped hallways ! All the walls throughout the hotel need <unknown> , and the wallpaper is peeling in places . In the room , several <unknown> outlets were hanging out of the connection , the carpets were stained , the bathrooms needed new <unknown> ( some mold <unknown> ) , the TV is very small ( 16 <unknown> ? ) and the windows very , very dirty . You wo n't get your room serviced unless you ask for it , <unknown> more than once . The `` <unknown> `` downstairs is run down , dark and kind of <unknown> . Food and room service are very expensive , as is parking ( $ <unknown> public and $ <unknown> valet ) . On the plus side , the bed was very comfortable , there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area , plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels <unknown> St. <unknown> street toward the north and south . You can see a <unknown> of Lake Michigan . <unknown> small , but clean . All in all , it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room , but I think it is overpriced , and I would not stay here again . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Omni with a <unknown> that what in town . The room was amazing . Just walking in , the hotel was gorgeous . I have no complaints . <unknown> Room service , <unknown> front desk . Many shops , beautiful <unknown> . Just an all around great hotel in a great City . <stop>
<s> We booked the Amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in Chicago . The hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location . However , when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only $ 10 more . That was great until I checked in . The corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley . During the night there were several homeless <unknown> <unknown> in the alley . It would seem that this is a place for them to <unknown> . On top of this , the <unknown> in the alley were being <unknown> by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning . The noise was crazy loud . I think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate <unknown> due to its location . The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful . <stop>
<s> We usually stay at the Sofitel but thought we would try the Conrad for a change . I do n't think I would rate this hotel over the Sofitel but it was still <unknown> class . But I do think the service was better at the Conrad . We arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left . <unknown> service goes down <unknown> then but our waiter <unknown> was the best . Even when I kept <unknown> my after dinner <unknown> . The meal may not have been The <unknown> House but it was still very good . The bar was ok , no <unknown> <unknown> . They did have the <unknown> 16 at $ 24 a drink , <unknown> . The room service was very quick . Our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the <unknown> during their visits . The only fault we could find was the temperature on the <unknown> floor . It was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off . Which was n't so bad since my wife <unknown> . The temp on the 5th where the lobby , bar , and restaurant was fine . We enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in <unknown> One last thing , if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast . Go to the <unknown> <unknown> , only a few blocks away . <stop>
<s> The Affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to Chicago . My wife and I stayed in an upgraded suite . Very large room , that is modern and has all the little touches . The staff was extremely helpful and professional . The location is excellent . The price is a good value for what you get . We simply could n't find anything to <unknown> . Highly recommended ! <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Talbott twice in the last few weeks . I was very pleased with every <unknown> of my stays . The staff , from doormen to front desk , to concierge , to housekeeping , were wonderful . The rooms were nicely sized and clean , and well stocked . I will return to the Talbott anytime ! <stop>
<s> We travel to Chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown . We were excited to try the Swissotel , but left disappointed . The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views , the staff was extremely rude . The man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call . He then did not say more than five <unknown> , which were `` I need a credit card '' . The lobby bar had <unknown> and was very cozy . The hotel information said it closed at <unknown> so we came back to hotel at <unknown> for a `` night cap '' , that was last call . That was fine for us , but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a `` night cap '' but did not make last call . Our night ended <unknown> to many unhappy people complaining and <unknown> no <unknown> from the employees . There are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer , no need to stay at the Swissotel again . Definitely do n't stay if you 're looking for a romantic weekend away , the employees will <unknown> your experience from the second you walk in the door . <stop>
<s> We booked directly with the Intercontinental -- a special room for our wedding night . After our wedding , we went to the Hotel excited and happy . When we got there , the night changed . We were treated rudely and with no <unknown> . They told us there was `` no room '' even though we had a confirmation number . Instead of showing any <unknown> , they told us to go sit down while they figured out `` what to do with us '' . My husband was in his <unknown> and I was in my wedding <unknown> ! No apology ! No concern ! We were given $ 20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where they 'd `` found '' a room . The Intercontinental <unknown> our wedding night . We are telling anyone and everyone of our experience . This place was supposed to be elegant . We 've never been treated so poorly . We will never stay in another Intercontinental Hotel and highly recommend you do not <unknown> to a place that would do this to a newly <unknown> couple ! ! ! <unknown> clear of this place . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Allegro for several days in August 2004 and I would <unknown> stay again . I had a very large room with a huge bathroom , although the property is a <unknown> theater so the rooms may <unknown> in size and layout . The lobby is comfortable with big <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , a nice place to enjoy the simple ( 2 choices , no <unknown> ) but pleasant wine reception . At night , there is not much going on in the immediate <unknown> , other than theater traffic , but it 's a short cab ride to Michigan Avenue shopping and River North restaurants . <stop>
<s> Do n't stay here if you take <unknown> in <unknown> you have a reservation . <unknown> 3 months ago , we booked a room here for our wedding night ( which is in less than 2 weeks ) . My <unknown> called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to <unknown> us to another hotel - no <unknown> , no <unknown> . Apparently it is my problem that their manager ca n't <unknown> the convention schedule . I do n't even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I do n't find their reservation system <unknown> . Unfortunately , due to the conference , there is n't any other place to stay . <stop>
<s> The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several <unknown> traveling into <unknown> The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan , Millennium Park , and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from . My <unknown> LOVED the <unknown> of the building , views from the rooms , the art on the walls , and <unknown> , clean & hip feeling of the hotel , but not `` too over the top '' for `` business '' . By far a better experience than your usual `` chain '' hotel where they <unknown> you in and out and boring rooms . Here you feel special ... for the same price . The lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave ( or catch a real rock star in the lobby ! ) <stop>
<s> My stay at the The James was perfect . My room was <unknown> <unknown> : the lighting , the storage space , the bar area , the eating <unknown> and everything else in the room was <unknown> and pretty to look at . The staff was friendly and and <unknown> <unknown> . The restaurant ( Primehouse ) <unknown> the above . Great service and one of the best <unknown> I 've had in a very long time . <stop>
<s> How about this had reservation confirmation in hand and still had to <unknown> with the registration desk about price on reservation . She tried to charge me price on bill they <unknown> under your door . <unknown> not on my watch ! Then about this room you gave me I understand this place is old but for the price you charge how about some <unknown> <unknown> ! You take a shower and the tub <unknown> with water will not drain this is absolutely <unknown> for this being a Hilton I think you should <unknown> back and take a look at how this place is operating . <unknown> : Fail Parking price : Fail <unknown> : Fail Thank you Hilton for for my super 8 experience in Chicago . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown Chicago hotel . I was completely impressed by the service ; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding . I checked in quite early ( no problem ) and was <unknown> checked in . My room had a somewhat <unknown> <unknown> of air <unknown> ( the ONLY negative from the entire stay ) , which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows . I do n't generally <unknown> much during my hotel stays , but <unknown> to say the doorman , housekeeping , the night manager and bartender at <unknown> , the day waiter at <unknown> , and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 <unknown> for anything . The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior . One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> . One wastebasket would make all the difference . All that said - what a great hotel ! ! Thanks , Omni - I had a great stay ! <stop>
<s> i stayed at this hotel for a week with my family this hotel is huge so clean has comfy beds <unknown> great staff <unknown> , <unknown> of being any nicer . stayed here for <unknown> it was fabulous second time in chicago and still want to go back again ... the hotel is within <unknown> distance to both state street and <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> right outside the hotel and the concierge can also <unknown> for mini <unknown> if your travelling with a big <unknown> , <unknown> also a <unknown> 2 mins away opposite the hotel . <unknown> Hotel for a great get away ... <stop>
<s> <unknown> A rate with upgrade to view room was less than $ 200 which also included breakfast <unknown> . Had a great view of river , lake , Wrigley <unknown> . & Tribune <unknown> . Most major restaurants , Shopping , <unknown> attractions within walking distance . Large room with a very comfortable bed . <stop>
<s> What a <unknown> , warm and friendly place to stay ! Very accomodating <unknown> 2 <unknown> beds and bathroom was fine ... <unknown> bit small compared to <unknown> hotels ... .but compared to <unknown> travel ... the place was <unknown> ! Would <unknown> . stay here again . Location is great too ! <stop>
<s> Beautiful hotel , but does n't have a lot to offer for the price . <unknown> and <unknown> in the room had stains on them , TV remote would not function properly . Valet service truly needs <unknown> . We payed quite a bit for overnight parking , and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave . When we asked to find out what was taking so long , we got <unknown> back and forth between bell hop and front desk , with no <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I recently stayed at this hotel with my family ( <unknown> / <unknown> ) . We had a terrific experience . I <unknown> the hotel through Priceline for $ 80 per night and paid an additional $ 75 per night for a suite on the <unknown> floor . My two young boys loved it as the view was <unknown> and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible . I found all the employees that we <unknown> with to be very friendly and accommodating . I would love to stay here again . <stop>
<s> I 've used Priceline for every trip I 've made back to Chicago and I 've been <unknown> to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown . This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East . Its conveniently located near the <unknown> stop on the El 's red line . That is the best part of our experience . When we checked in we were charged additional for <unknown> from a king bed to two queens . I 've never had that issue at any other hotel I 've stayed at . The room 's decor was outdated and the TV was tiny . The hotel charges for <unknown> of Internet . You could hear people in the hallway and when you 're in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms . We were n't in Chicago to stay in the hotel however , for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely is n't the place . ... read more <stop>
<s> What can I say ... this <unknown> to be our <unknown> hotel in Chicago because of its location , its historic and gorgeous pool , it amazing Sunday brunch , it 's relatively low price compared to comparable hotels , its <unknown> <unknown> of the ambassador membership ... All of the above has fallen <unknown> by the <unknown> with a <unknown> <unknown> . Let 's break it down : Location : I 'll <unknown> that it 's still great . <unknown> a corner room in the <unknown> tower higher than the <unknown> floor with a view of Michigan Ave <unknown> the river . Its historic and gorgeous pool : <unknown> <unknown> ! When asked when it will <unknown> , the hotel staff actually said , `` Maybe never . '' Its amazing Sunday brunch : Zest is gone , and his been replaced by a very dark <unknown> <unknown> restaurant that <unknown> up much of the lobby and second entrance . ( The lobby , by the way , used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit . Also no longer ... ) . The food is very bad . Very . Bad . There are so many restaurants in this city . Do yourself a <unknown> and go somewhere else to eat . Its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels : <unknown> on my review of everything else . Go to the Drake , or the Peninsula . <unknown> worth the extra money ... That , or <unknown> to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for ... The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton , but you get a worse experience ! Its <unknown> <unknown> of the ambassador membership : I <unknown> our membership after this <unknown> . <unknown> of the membership <unknown> early check-in ( granted , when available ) ... but our room was n't ready until 6pm . This is obviously after normal check-in . The staff was <unknown> , and not <unknown> or helpful . I tried to speak with the manager about our room , waited in long line to speak with someone , only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name . In a <unknown> . Go somewhere else . <unknown> : Go to <unknown> tea next door instead of the Starbucks in the hotel . <unknown> better food and coffee . <stop>
<s> <unknown> a wedding in Chicago ; Sofitel is new , <unknown> , very very modern ( W hotel style - <unknown> ) and a great location . However , I miss the <unknown> of a less trendy hotel . We checked in at 7 PM and our room was n't ready - when they gave me a key the maid was still in the room making it up for me ! ! ! I had to wait in the hallway ... . On the weekend I came back for a nap at about <unknown> PM after <unknown> the room at <unknown> AM and it still was n't made up . The housekeeping line was never answered so had to call front desk to get someone to make up my room . Also called housekeeping for a new <unknown> and they never brought me one ... .I gave up ... This is a hot , <unknown> hotel but for my next visit , I think I 'd prefer some of the classic amenities <unknown> <unknown> housekeeping , a somewhat larger room that you can walk around , and a less trendy , hot , loud clientele . I 'm over 40 . <stop>
<s> First let me say , the front office people at Hotel Monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what I 'd <unknown> . There are some other problems ; the furnishings are quite <unknown> , and housekeeping was n't very helpful . We booked a suite and the sofa bed , chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use . I 've attached pictures , so you can see the <unknown> <unknown> in the sofa and the lack of pillows . Comfortable it was not ! The chair bottom is all broken down too . I <unknown> one of the <unknown> <unknown> to view our furniture , and a <unknown> <unknown> was made in our rate . As to housekeeping , we had ordered an in-room coffee service ( which Kimpton 's web site <unknown> is there , but you have to specifically request ) and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee . We had to call the front desk every day . And , housekeeping <unknown> our fish and on our next to last day we found it <unknown> dead at the top of the fish bowl . I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was <unknown> . These things may not matter to you , but if you plan to spend a week , like we did , you might want to be comfortable . The bedroom and bathroom were superior ; just the living room was bad . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early December , we stay there that weekend every December and we think it is the best location in the city for us . We like State Street better than Michigan Avenue and the Palmer House is right there . We stayed in the Towers , in a room with two double beds and 2 baths . The room was not huge , but very comfortable . The towers area was recently <unknown> and it shows , the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen <unknown> on the walls , comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the <unknown> . There is a continental breakfast in the morning , appetizers during <unknown> hour and <unknown> are laid out until the room closes . There is a fridge stocked with soft drinks , water and juice that are <unknown> for the taking . We were very pleased with the upgraded Towers , everyone should check it out ! <stop>
<s> I reserved the `` Rock star '' suite for my boyfriend 's birthday months and months in <unknown> . When we arrived at the Hotel Monaco , they told us that they <unknown> booked the room . This was after many <unknown> to the hotel <unknown> about the room and if it was available . They tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant - which we did n't even use . I felt we were taken advantage of because we were young . The doorman did n't make us feel any better when he told us that it was n't the first time they did this for the `` rock star '' suite . However , the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake I ordered . If it was n't for the room <unknown> - It would have been a wonderful stay . <stop>
<s> I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood , cost and amenities . The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open , you would n't know it . You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock . The beds are <unknown> up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale <unknown> <unknown> and not a `` nicer historic hotel . '' I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime . It was a very frustrating experience . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent . I was given a very large room with great views of the city ; the breakfast was extremely good ; and the location was as central as I could have <unknown> for . The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning <unknown> . In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too . Highly recommended as a base for <unknown> Chicago . <stop>
<s> My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago . We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel . I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel . Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I could n't set up a pack and <unknown> for my son . I had to call and `` upgrade '' my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep . The lower <unknown> have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn . The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty . I will NEVER stay there again . <stop>
<s> We were at the Hotel Allegro for an <unknown> <unknown> event . I could not have expected worse . At first glance , you figured it could n't be too bad as a Kimpton . The unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent . However , the rooms just <unknown> . <unknown> your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size . <unknown> in a king size bed and add a bathroom that 's also 1/3 the size . The building has that old hotel smell where things are <unknown> but covered up with some paint smell . The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but <unknown> you of that <unknown> <unknown> you <unknown> with 5 other people out of college . The <unknown> peeling on the base <unknown> , the carpet is new , but something is wrong . I would stay at the Marriott , <unknown> , Westin , or any where else . <stop>
<s> Having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website , I arrived tired from <unknown> , to find that they had <unknown> my booking and had no room on that night , but did have rooms for the rest of the week . They booked me in to another ( not as nice ) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights <unknown> . On my return to the hotel next day , I was upgraded to the Club level . What really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake ... <unknown> . Of course , the hotel itself ( particularly on the 32nd floor ) is excellent . I will definitely be back . <stop>
<s> The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong <unknown> on my choice to book this hotel . Unfortunately , the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its <unknown> . The front desk staff was rude , the doormen were usually busy <unknown> or <unknown> on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door . There are three elevators but good luck with them all working . They are very very small and when only one is up and running ... you end up waiting a long time for one . Not fun when you are on the <unknown> floor . The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at all ... the room felt <unknown> and <unknown> . We put the <unknown> as low as it would let us ( 65 ) and the room never went below 78 . ( and it was <unknown> outside the whole trip ! ! ! ) . There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant . Internet is not free either ... Overall , I would never stay here again . <stop>
<s> I was surprised by the fact that there were no extra sheets or blankets to make up the <unknown> a bed . I called the desk and asked for some and they said that I could n't have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed . My husband was <unknown> and I wanted the bed set up so I would n't disturb him . but they were <unknown> moved and would n't bring the sheets . I ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket . They could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket , I did n't pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress . <unknown> ! <unknown> of concern for the customer . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Swissotel for a special birthday weekend for my wife from <unknown> 25 to <unknown> . I had called ahead to ask for a nice room and to order flowers for my wife . <unknown> <unknown> , the Concierge , made <unknown> for flowers , early check-in and we had a great room . Our room was the <unknown> floor with a view facing the city . Room was large , everything looked like new , great bed , large bathroom with separate shower , great <unknown> . A beautiful <unknown> of flowers arrived upon our arrival . The hotel is about 10 mins from everything , not close but not far from anything . <unknown> a great restaurant , 2 <unknown> outside where I had a <unknown> . A really nice pool and hot tub on the 42nd floor . I would recommend this hotel to anyone and thanks to <unknown> for making our trip very special . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Fairmont two nights for the <unknown> art fair at the Navy Pier . I was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and <unknown> it correctly , which is quite <unknown> . Everyone <unknown> and welcomed us . The lobby looks clean and friendly , not <unknown> , but not at all tired or worn . Our room , also clean and comfortably furnished , was larger than we expected , with a clean , modern bath and a lovely view of the Navy Pier and the lake . We did not eat at the restaurant , but it looked attractive . Our only problem was that we had asked for <unknown> pillows , upon <unknown> the room , upon checking in , and calling housekeeping . After waiting an hour , we went to bed . The next day the check-in desk person was extremely <unknown> and by the time we returned , all the <unknown> were replaced with <unknown> and <unknown> materials . The hotel is convenient to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. We would stay there again , <unknown> we could get good rates . <stop>
<s> I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked . While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in it 's decor ( less <unknown> and more funky <unknown> ) it is not nearly as nice . The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice . The rooms are also smaller . The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though , is the bathroom . It has an old <unknown> floor , with an old sink , and old toilet . It <unknown> me of something you would find in a men 's locker room . Although the Allegro has <unknown> a nice mirror , it does not make up for the limited <unknown> space and dingy <unknown> . Also , the layout of the bathroom is terrible . The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your <unknown> as you sit on the toilet . Also , the room is not very clean as well . The floor in my room was dirty and I found <unknown> in the drawers . I would recommend staying at the Monaco , Hard Rock , or <unknown> for a hotel that is a little less <unknown> but still nice . <stop>
<s> My family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early August . We were promised a room with two double beds . When we arrived ( earlier than most ) we were told they were 45 double beds short . We reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed . We had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away . <unknown> did we know we were being <unknown> a daily fee for this bed . The <unknown> could not handle the large group that was at this hotel . The <unknown> and <unknown> were <unknown> <unknown> and we did not have towels one day until very late at night . The managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating . We were so disappointed in this hotel . Also , they do not have a pool here . If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay $ 20 a day to use it . $ 80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous . Do yourself a <unknown> , if you want to be <unknown> and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise , go elsewhere . Chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one . I never heard back from <unknown> on this issue when I called and <unknown> so obviously they do n't care , even when I told them I 'd write a review on this website . Chicago is an awesome city though . We loved it ! <stop>
<s> The elevator system was impossible . It seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse . Many people waited <unknown> minutes and some <unknown> out to the <unknown> <unknown> . It happened several times . I had read about it before booking but guess I did n't take it seriously . It 'd be a deal <unknown> for any future return unless I heard clearly it was <unknown> . Also , I always think it 's <unknown> that you have to pay extra for WiFi . Area recommendations North Michigan Avenue and Lake front areas are best . <stop>
<s> It 's so frustrating when a hotel <unknown> a deal <unknown> on its website , <unknown> said deal is available on certain <unknown> . But , when you call to make a reservation based on that deal , they tell you it 's not available . There are rooms available , but not the deal . Then they try to <unknown> tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal . I get that . Then just <unknown> that on the website . `` Here 's a great deal . . . but only a small number of people will actually get it . '' So much for the great reviews about service . . . I could n't even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed . Bad form , Conrad , bad form . <stop>
<s> I got a Sunday night stay for only $ 50 off of Priceline.com , so it would be hard to complain ... but this was truly a great hotel , even if I paid double . The first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the Hyatt Regency Chicago is <unknown> . The lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant , plenty of <unknown> , <unknown> etc to people watch and a lake with water <unknown> . You take the <unknown> to the <unknown> in area . The hotel let me check in at <unknown> ( I had a 3pm check in time ) . I <unknown> you call ahead like I did so they know you are coming <unknown> women at the desk was friendly and when I requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me `` I have a room on the <unknown> floor with a <unknown> of the river or you can go higher with no view '' . I thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that I wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall . The rooms are big ( I had a <unknown> room ) The beds were beautiful with great pillows , blankets , <unknown> etc . An <unknown> alarm clock was a nice <unknown> <unknown> touch to the room . Great to <unknown> in your <unknown> , listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of <unknown> Chicago . The view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries . Another great feature is the concierge area 's computers that <unknown> you access to <unknown> your boarding pass before you get to the airport . You simply look at the screen , <unknown> on your <unknown> <unknown> and following the <unknown> . I had my boarding passes in about a minute . Came in handy when I got to <unknown> and was able to <unknown> a long line of frustrated <unknown> . I was only in the hotel for 1 day , but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences I have had and I travel <unknown> . It is a business hotel , but definitely a great choice for families and <unknown> . Definitely would stay here again when <unknown> <unknown> through Chicago . <stop>
<s> Just returned from a one night stay at the Knickerbocker , and I will not return . It came nowhere near being worth the price I paid . Hotel Burnham is twice the hotel at half the price ! The bathroom was <unknown> small and smelled <unknown> . We had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered ( which <unknown> may as well have been paper towels , nothing <unknown> about them at all ) . We did n't have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered . Room service <unknown> was left outside our door all night . All in all , it was a very disappointing stay . The only redeeming quality of this hotel seems to be its location . And for me , it 's just not worth it . <stop>
<s> We attended a <unknown> <unknown> in Chicago in <unknown> <unknown> . There were 10 girls total . We had 5 rooms ... and I did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend . Never been to <unknown> before , I booked our hotel based on reviews from TA . And we were not disappointed . The staff is wonderful , the happy hour was just fabulous . The room was nice and clean , with a great double headed shower and Aveda products was an extra bonus ! Then you also get free internet in your room ! The hotel was chic and hip without the <unknown> . We still talk about what a wonderful time we had ... and we all agree that if we ever go back to Chicago we will be staying at the Amalfi again . <unknown> me the <unknown> do n't do it <unknown> ! <stop>
<s> We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010 . The room was great we had purchased it at a <unknown> at work for a <unknown> <unknown> for <unknown> <unknown> . So we probably paid more then we needed but it was for <unknown> . We were woke up at <unknown> in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall <unknown> they must of woke everyone up on our floor . Of course one of the rooms they <unknown> was right next to ours . They were so loud <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> on the walls that we thought there was maybe a <unknown> going on . We called the front desk who sent security up immediately . Security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave . We called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally <unknown> down . Because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so <unknown> . When we complained about it in the morning <unknown> would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate . Well we still paid for it ! ! . They would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had . We would never stay at this hotel again , obviously they really do n't care about their guests . <stop>
<s> We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $ <unknown> ( <unknown> rate ! ) and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel . The staff was so polite and <unknown> to our every need . The room was <unknown> , clean , and had a large bathroom . We had a <unknown> view of Lake Michigan , which was an added bonus . On the 42nd floor , they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides . <unknown> ! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier . We ca n't wait to go to the Swissotel again ! <stop>
<s> Stayed over Memorial <unknown> for 2 <unknown> , 2 rooms . Great Hotel , we always love breakfast in morning , and drinks in even when <unknown> . <unknown> the corner from magnificent Mile , and close to lots of restaurants . Staff was great , we even checked in early before noon , and other room available less than hour later . <unknown> fruit was available to us , and bell guys are cool . Suites are on small side compared to other <unknown> but no complaints here , house cleaning kept our room clean , and we felt safe ! <stop>
<s> A friend highly recommended this hotel and we could n't have been <unknown> ! It was wonderful <unknown> my husband and kids were already <unknown> our next trip there before we had even left the hotel . The kids loved the goldfish in the room and thought the window <unknown> were the best . <stop>
<s> <unknown> during a busy <unknown> conference in Chicago . Most hotels booked solid . The full hotel <unknown> you to meet a wide <unknown> of customers . Everyone is complaining about service , cleanliness , and overall experience . Location is good . Hotel is tired . <unknown> <unknown> . Too many cool properties to choose from in this town , will never stay here again and will <unknown> Hilton in general <stop>
<s> I found this wonderful Hotel ! The location is awesome , just minutes away from all the shopping , Restaurants and <unknown> you could possibly want . I was in town for an interview , so I was really nervous . I ended up <unknown> the Hotel Restaurant for my interview and they took such a good care of us , they made me feel so comfortable that I was hardly nervous at all . And the place was pack ! The room was superb ! Really cool design . I had a room they call an apartment , and it was fantastic ! The natural light you get in this room is awesome , and I am very sensitive to dark places . They have a full bar in the room , which I was able to use to <unknown> my friends that night . I went to the gym for a little bit of exercise and I have to say I have never seen such a <unknown> facility in a hotel . All the staff made me feel like I was family . They were available to me at any time , and so friendly ! I will definitely be back for another stay . <stop>
<s> My stay at the Ambassador East was great ! The hotel is in a great location in the charming Gold Coast neighborhood of downtown Chicago . Gave me the feeling of staying in a Chicago neighborhood <unknown> the concrete <unknown> of downtown , but the Magnificent Mile and Rush Street are just a few blocks from the front door . The staff was very friendly . Also , really enjoyed having drinks in the historic Pump Room . They had a live <unknown> on Saturday , and I really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the <unknown> throughout the lounge that visited from years gone by . Definitely recommend it . <stop>
<s> The Allegro in downtown Chicago is a great <unknown> part of the Kimpton <unknown> boutique hotels the Allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a <unknown> <unknown> they offer complimentary and decent wine <unknown> in the late afternoon and the hotel <unknown> you access to everything the loop has to offer in this <unknown> city . i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the <unknown> ' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the <unknown> otherwise you are looking at <unknown> parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great <unknown> , comfortable beds and in my case great views . if you go to <unknown> group website and sign up for <unknown> you will be <unknown> to great rates on certain days / <unknown> does a great job and their properties are `` class <unknown> '' <stop>
<s> I was attending a conference at the <unknown> . They were booked up and I shared a room at the Hard Rock for a week by <unknown> . What a lucky break . This is a beautiful hotel . I am not a fan of all that <unknown> <unknown> and find it a little <unknown> . What I loved was the way the Hard Rock left the beautiful old hotel <unknown> <unknown> , and decorated around the basic <unknown> . My room was CLEAN , CLEAN , CLEAN . I want to comment on the staff . What an <unknown> group of people . This included the doormen , the front desk , the consierge . They were wonderful ! Every morning one of the bell men would find my TV morning news show for me in the bar , while I <unknown> their courtesy coffee . They brought us a refrigerator , <unknown> dock , and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in . I had a hard time <unknown> the airport <unknown> . The consierge took care of it for me . While I was waiting for the <unknown> am airport shuttle , one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back . I just could n't get over how nice and friendly everyone was ... <unknown> place to stay . I hope to go back with my husband . <stop>
<s> We needed an extra night in Chicago after a <unknown> stay at The <unknown> and won a <unknown> <unknown> for The James @ $ <unknown> . This is one of the nicest hotels that I 've ever stayed in . Bathroom aside , we felt it <unknown> The <unknown> in comfort and level of service . I <unknown> all of the <unknown> previously written and would love to stay here anytime I 'm in town . <stop>
<s> I 'd been <unknown> for a cool , <unknown> hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend . I thought I 'd found a <unknown> in the Affinia ... <unknown> disappointed ! ! In <unknown> of the fact that our reservation was for two adults , we arrived to find our room had a <unknown> bed . What ? ! I was <unknown> , but after a <unknown> flight and a 2 hour cab ride , was too tired to make a <unknown> . We were <unknown> after all the <unknown> and planned on attending an event that night , so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple . I was told that room service would call <unknown> back to take my order ... and nothing happened . I did n't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs . Nothing special ; <unknown> , dessert and <unknown> for two still came out to $ <unknown> ... I am no <unknown> , I 'm <unknown> aware that everything costs more in Chicago , but this just was n't worth it . Our room was by the elevator w/ parking garage view ... the bathroom was tiny , shower <unknown> was stained , funky toilet <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> that `` rude <unknown> '' lighting normally found in <unknown> <unknown> rooms , <unknown> , `` <unknown> <unknown> , have I looked that bad this whole time ? ! '' If you 're a traveler who <unknown> using the in-room <unknown> , they charge for their <unknown> <unknown> ( I do n't use these , but ... come on ) . Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar , but weak drinks ... That night , our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms . But the <unknown> was that weekend ; the hotel was so busy I did n't want to be a <unknown> . I ca n't believe I was so impressed with this place online . Next time I 'll <unknown> pay more to stay someplace that 's actually a treat . <stop>
<s> This is one of my favorite <unknown> properties . I have stayed at a lot of hotels ( mostly Starwood ) in <unknown> but all around , this is my favorite based on cost , amenities and downtown location . I really like it <unknown> with <unknown> the taxi because I am greeted by <unknown> who has been there for years . He <unknown> the best greeting from <unknown> to <unknown> and is always happy ! He obviously <unknown> his job . <unknown> at the front desk are always nice and efficient . If you like to workout , <unknown> <unknown> their fitness center . Another one who <unknown> their job and serves guests well . Great lake / river view while working out . On this particular trip I was <unknown> in a <unknown> ; however , <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> was able to take care of a frequent guest . I considered it a `` minor miracle '' based on hotel <unknown> . The maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient . Another great experience . <stop>
<s> We had a king deluxe room for 2 nights . We reserved the room through the hotel website with <unknown> discount . We paid $ <unknown> . We enjoy boutique hotels , as they have so much more personality and personal service . This hotel was no <unknown> . Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful . The room was clean , well decorated , spacious and quiet . We were offered at check-in a room with a view , but <unknown> it was across from the elevator , so we decided to take the quiet , large room with no view . The location of the hotel was perfect for us , we saw <unknown> while in Chicago and had no problem walking to the theater . We also walked the Magnificient Mile and found the location perfect ( we like to walk ) . We had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a <unknown> experience . We ate room service for breakfast each morning , and the food was good and the <unknown> were quite large . We would definitely stay here again . <stop>
<s> Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago . For the prices and for being <unknown> an <unknown> ... I would n't consider it that good . The rooms were solid . The view was ok ( but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave. ) The service was ok . The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else . We came here for a <unknown> wedding . <unknown> was fine . <unknown> <unknown> was a small <unknown> of <unknown> with <unknown> everything else . <unknown> was <unknown> . I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an <unknown> that it would be worth it . I personally preferred the Conrad . <unknown> prices and better service . <stop>
<s> My 3 <unknown> and I stayed here for a long weekend , we had a wonderful time . We arrived early around <unknown> and they let us into our room . This was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later Room was very clean as was the bathroom . With 4 women we needed extra towels , they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered . Room was also quiet , construction going on behind us and we never heard anything . <unknown> comfy and so were the <unknown> ... Good location for Michigan Ave. All in all a wonderful stay . Would return . <stop>
<s> The Knickerbocker hotel is fantastic ! It 's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the <unknown> charm and fresh comfort all at once . The hotel has a fabulous location . It 's a one minute walk to the <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> , and about a 5 minute walk to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ( the best <unknown> and cream cheese <unknown> ) , Macys and <unknown> . This location ca n't be beat . You 're at one end of the magnificent mile , so it makes for easy <unknown> , as you do n't start in the middle and then <unknown> . The hotel staff are super helpful and friendly . <unknown> in and out was very smooth , and the concierge ( <unknown> ) was amazing . She booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us , and recommended an incredible restaurant called <unknown> which was a 5 minute walk . It was the greatest <unknown> restaurant I have ever been to , and I ca n't recommend it more . The rooms are small but not too small . We had a beautiful big <unknown> flat screen , <unknown> phones , a rain shower , ample clean towels , and beautiful marble <unknown> . The hotel rooms have <unknown> charm to them and made me feel like I was at a 5 star hotel in Europe . The beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like <unknown> . The only complaint I had was that housekeeping woke us up at <unknown> one morning when the <unknown> on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on . When we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit <unknown> . The issue was corrected , though , and it did n't happen again during our 4 night stay . The hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - <unknown> cheese with mini <unknown> soup for <unknown> . Very cute . Their late night menu , however , is lacking . It would have been nice to see some soup on there . That being said , I <unknown> order from room service when on vacation , so I really do n't see that being a big deal . Overall I would recommend this hotel without hesitation . I think we paid about <unknown> a night and I would say it was worth far more than that . We had a wonderful experience and I truly look forward to staying there again ... <unknown> n't stay anywhere else ! <stop>
<s> We paid $ 75 a night through Priceline , which is excellent for June . Our room had a fantastic view of the Hancock Building and the river . The room was large , clean and had a couch , easy chair and desk chair . The bedding was the newer <unknown> ' style , the bed was comfortable , the bathroom was large and , well , we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way . We ate at the lobby restaurant , which is <unknown> decorated and was <unknown> with <unknown> when we were there . We only got <unknown> <unknown> , so I do n't know if the food , in general , is good or not . The <unknown> was <unknown> . Our only complaint was the $ 48 fee to park your car <unknown> and the $ 13 daily fee for the internet . Many places are <unknown> free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this <unknown> . We hated to leave ! <stop>
<s> Very pleasant front staff , wine in the evening in the lobby , large rooms , great rates , and free Internet for those that are members of the <unknown> program . Overall an excellent value . Close to the El for those coming in from either Midway or O'Hare <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I checked into this hotel , <unknown> <unknown> on <unknown> . Next day , I woke up with bed bug bites , numerous , on my arm and back . We reported this to the management who <unknown> us to <unknown> <unknown> and promised to get the room <unknown> and `` taken care of '' . I insisted that they get all my clothes <unknown> , which they did . <unknown> , no one from the management , other than the security guy who came when we first complained , even offered any apology for the <unknown> . I missed couple of meetings that day . The next day , I called as I forgot something in the previous room , only to discover that the room was already assigned to the next guest . So much for <unknown> ! <stop>
<s> I stayed for just one <unknown> at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other TA <unknown> but I was not let down . I got the room via <unknown> @ $ 70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot . Since I had nothing to lose , I asked to be moved to a `` room with a view '' . The front desk attendant ( <unknown> ) wanted to make sure that the room I had at first was clean and was in order and I assured her that it was . She then moved me up to the <unknown> floor with ease and it took about 1 minute . I was quite surprised as I have heard that they treat <unknown> and Hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers . The new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the Navy Pier , a few other <unknown> <unknown> and the beautiful <unknown> of Lake Michigan . All this for $ 70 ? <unknown> ! I <unknown> room service and walked to the local <unknown> <unknown> as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious ! The room was comfy , had an ample closet and room to <unknown> as well as a convenient internet connection location . I didnt use it since I <unknown> staying that long but at least it was on the desk . The bed and pillows were very comfy , but I <unknown> at about <unknown> in the morning <unknown> from the comfy but VERY <unknown> and somewhat <unknown> duvet on the bed . This was a great deal for the price and I would absolutely stay here again . <stop>
<s> The room was very spacious with very nice , <unknown> <unknown> . The beds felt like lying on a <unknown> , and there were four pillows on each bed , two <unknown> and two down so you could choose which you like better . The bathroom was very nice also . Overall , I was very pleased with the stay . You had to show your room key to get in after ten <unknown> . I thought that was a good security issue . It has a great location too , close to downtown . I would recommend it . The <unknown> were very classy . Most hotels have two of the same <unknown> art , boring <unknown> and <unknown> pillows . The Hyatt Regency was just the opposite . <stop>
<s> <unknown> lobby , comfy beds , nice sheets but , we were given a ( not <unknown> , a little dated ) room on the 5th floor which had a view of the <unknown> <unknown> structure , and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night . At the Hilton , one is charged for Internet access on each device per hour . ( We stayed in the middle of <unknown> and received total access for free . ) We did n't drink the $ <unknown> water or try the $ <unknown> . Breakfast buffet . The staff was friendly , but of course you tip for a smile . They did give us a <unknown> for free as we had asked for a room with a <unknown> couch as we were a party of 5 . Did n't use the gym or pool on the 8th floor , but looked nice ( small pool . ) No view of the water possible , though we were right at Grant Park . We tried to view the <unknown> from a higher story , no such luck . ... read more <stop>
<s> I arrived here at about <unknown> after a flight from California . I did n't know about the renovation when I made the reservations , but that did n't bother me very much . I was helped by a man at the front desk named <unknown> , who was friendly enough , but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay . He gave me NO information about anything . I had no idea where breakfast was served , or even if there <unknown> breakfast . There was also an <unknown> unpleasant woman working behind the desk ( she was n't wearing a name <unknown> but was <unknown> American , <unknown> with short hair ) who seemed to be actually <unknown> <unknown> . It made me very uncomfortable and <unknown> to say , made me feel <unknown> . I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel . I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit , and again was met with <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> . I also watched her <unknown> with another guest and saw her <unknown> with the same <unknown> and bad <unknown> . No matter what may be going on in one 's life , when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is <unknown> at the door and put on a smile . I was <unknown> by her <unknown> . My room was alright , there was no clock which I found very odd . Since I came from a different time <unknown> my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct , especially upon <unknown> up in the morning . It would have been nice to have a clock . There was also no <unknown> on local sites , <unknown> , restaurant <unknown> , or even anything with the hotel 's name and address in the room . Also , the mattress was the <unknown> worst mattress I 've ever slept on in my life . I woke up every morning with a <unknown> back and <unknown> . I 've had better sleep on a hard , <unknown> <unknown> . It was <unknown> . <unknown> another person posted , my tub did not drain either , and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found . Maybe they were around somewhere , but I was n't made aware of it at check-in , and I did n't want to go downstairs and ask for <unknown> of being treated like I was a <unknown> to the employees . The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance , but I absolutely would not stay here again . I 've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel , which was a <unknown> because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations . <stop>
<s> I just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - what a treat ! The hotel website offers a great rate , and what I found was affordable luxury . I asked for a high floor & found myself with a fabulous view , in a room where there was an <unknown> <unknown> in the bathroom , <unknown> robes and slippers , turndown service , <unknown> <unknown> toiletries , a fluffy down <unknown> , and a wonderful <unknown> bed . The bathroom was so clean that it <unknown> . The service was impeccable as well . Even my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous <unknown> of excellent <unknown> , <unknown> , & <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . The decor was unique & the location convenient . Check out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby . This is a <unknown> hotel . <stop>
<s> While this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing , I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . The rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny , all of which is to be expected in an old <unknown> hotel , but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel ( ever ! ) . The <unknown> <unknown> and base <unknown> are cracked and it <unknown> to only have been painted over and over again . The newer tub <unknown> in the bathroom is merely <unknown> above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it <unknown> under your feet . The shower <unknown> are old and the <unknown> is not clean . This hotel has not been <unknown> the updating that has been done are merely <unknown> . There is no fan <unknown> in the bathroom and the carpet is <unknown> of a very hard <unknown> , <unknown> concrete with no <unknown> in between . The lobby is <unknown> because of the large open bar in the small space . We were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights , we left after 2 and went to another hotel . <stop>
<s> Stayed here for 4 nights in <unknown> . From check in the stay was perfect all <unknown> , staff were so <unknown> and friendly especially <unknown> and <unknown> . The location could n't be better right on Michigan Avenue so easy access to everything . Room was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day . Will definately recommend it to friends and family . <stop>
<s> <unknown> years ago , we had a tiny `` room '' and indifferent service . This time , the service was superb and friendly throughout , with special <unknown> for the waiters and <unknown> at the coffee <unknown> , the door and bell <unknown> , and the hilton <unknown> person at the front desk . They even <unknown> our price ( to <unknown> high ) when we <unknown> a few days before our stay . When we want to stay south of the river downtown , we will be back <stop>
<s> My experiences at the Fairmont Chicago were less than <unknown> . I try to be fair when I write my reviews , but fair is not in the Fairmont Chicago <unknown> . From <unknown> up to check in I felt the <unknown> start . $ <unknown> a night for parking is terrible for this area $ <unknown> $ 35 is the average and that is not affordable as it is but $ <unknown> is just disgusting to put on your guests . The parking was more than my car rental . In the room the internet is not <unknown> it is $ 16 for standard and $ 25 for some sort of <unknown> upgraded internet service . <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , who charges for internet <unknown> and even worse upgraded services . I did n't go online every day of my 8 day stay because of the cost . One <unknown> on the internet that they do n't tell you upon check in is that if you sign up for the free <unknown> Fairmont club you will receive free in room internet service , I found that out on the last day of my stay . Other issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good . The bed was hard and uncomfortable . And I would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city . On a good note the Aria resturant in the Fairmont has a tremendous staff and serves up the best burger and <unknown> I have ever had , loved the complimentary <unknown> and <unknown> to start , and the complimentary <unknown> <unknown> to finish . <stop>
<s> Upon first entering the hotel , we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered . <unknown> our 2 week stay , they told us to `` have a nice day '' as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return . Breakfast is served in the AM , and the servers were as <unknown> as the bellmen . It was a very enjoyable stay . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Conrad for only one evening but it was such an amazing room we would have liked to stay longer ! We were on the newly renovated 9th floor and the room was gorgeous and super clean ! There was a flat screen , <unknown> sound system and even an <unknown> for our <unknown> . <unknown> was free and they bring you a free bottle of water at turn down . Everyone was very helpful and so friendly . We ca n't wait to go back again ! <stop>
<s> In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer , it <unknown> if your air conditioner does not work . After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a <unknown> fan which on low speed sound as if a <unknown> was <unknown> over my room . I requested a room change and a not so polite , <unknown> night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity . Maybe a manager could help me in the morning . The next day went by and no call was received . At <unknown> , I called the front desk . No one was aware of my problem . <unknown> 45 minutes later , a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available . I <unknown> it was <unknown> . <unknown> was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer . I was <unknown> correct . The bathroom door of the new room did not close . Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the <unknown> part of the <unknown> . As for room <unknown> , I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner . What 's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room . And did not offer any <unknown> or <unknown> for my <unknown> night in the <unknown> ! This hotel need a major <unknown> ! ! <stop>
<s> They allowed <unknown> to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water . We called security twice for them to do nothing about the party . When they finally came up about 30 people <unknown> out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes . When we called back nothing was done about it . My 2 year old son was <unknown> by all the loud music and <unknown> . <unknown> we get up the next morning at <unknown> to get ready only to find that we have no running water . After the maintenance man <unknown> around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep . They did not resolve this issue . They just keep <unknown> my complaint to `` managers '' <unknown> . It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Allegro Hotel while <unknown> for a <unknown> in Chicago . I read the reviews and they were <unknown> , but since the property was suggested by the <unknown> ( due to location ) , I booked a room . <unknown> to the reviews , the room was extremely small , was cold ( the <unknown> blew in cold air in <unknown> degree weather ) , and just generally uncomfortable . There was no closet so I hung my <unknown> on the <unknown> of the door of the <unknown> room . The bathroom was extremely small and although tidy , not especially clean ( it was <unknown> ) . The bed ( which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full ) was quite low and the sheets were hard . Because I arrived late , I ordered room service . There was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> . Although there is free wireless ( a plus ) , I kept getting <unknown> out of the system and had to , no <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> a record 16 times . Finally , to top it all off , the <unknown> stopped working just a little before <unknown> . I was only there for one evening ( not even 12 hours ) but that was enough for me . This is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but I 've stayed at better 2 star properties . On the positive side , the staff is nice and friendly , the food is reasonably good , and the lobby is really <unknown> . There is a martini bar ( although as I was coming in , a hotel guest was complaining about it being <unknown> <unknown> ) that looked interesting . Overall though , not the best stay I 've had . I wo n't be staying again . <stop>
<s> Here are my experiences : - Had three rooms reserved , when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room <unknown> , gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - <unknown> not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty ( we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys ) - In room <unknown> <unknown> pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the <unknown> floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - When we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room . - When we received our <unknown> , the credit card <unknown> were still wrong . I stay at `` <unknown> '' hotels a lot and I have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one . This hotel should do Chicago a service and just close its doors . <unknown> to this experience , I will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and <unknown> business that are just as bad . <stop>
<s> As others have said , once all the construction <unknown> are <unknown> I suspect that the prices this hotel can ( <unknown> ) charge will put it out of our price range . Which will be a <unknown> because it is an excellent hotel , & the location could n't be better . The room was very spacious , with separate sitting & <unknown> areas & a nice bathroom . Only 3 minor points : downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast ( coffee & pastries ) , but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this ; the cost of internet - $ <unknown> - is a bit <unknown> especially when lots of motels now offer it free ; there was only <unknown> <unknown> in the rooms , which was n't that nice . But none of these really <unknown> a really enjoyable stay . <stop>
<s> It is always interesting going to a high quality Hotel . I can not help but think about the service and the value . Maybe I have too high expectations . <unknown> the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great . But , the room was not well cleaned , a little <unknown> <unknown> and they <unknown> a watch that I left in the room . The hotel where immediately worried about there <unknown> situation and not the service . I noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel . I know that this is always a <unknown> but really did not expect it at a hotel like this . Overall , Chicago <unknown> my expectations but the <unknown> did not . Stay else where . <stop>
<s> <unknown> just off the <unknown> <unknown> and about two blocks from the river the Fairmont Chicago offers an excellent location to <unknown> as home base for your trip to Chicago . The staff were friendly and helpful , <unknown> many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city . There are many attractions <unknown> easy walking distance ( The Art Institute is a must see and Millenium Park is a fun visit ) . The <unknown> tour by river <unknown> a dock that is very close to the Fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby . The rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense . We would definitely stay here again . <stop>
<s> We stayed here for one night , and found it a hotel that <unknown> on conferences rather than your normal guest . We found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the <unknown> for this - @ $ 200 for the night . We felt when we checked in that if you were n't with the conference , then why were we staying in the hotel . The guy at the main door did n't even hold it open when you are trying to <unknown> your bags into the lobby , we then had to <unknown> for 15-20 minutes just to check in . We were not given any information about the hotel and when I <unknown> down to reception at one <unknown> to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through , I was just short of being asked why did n't I bring my <unknown> with me so I could use the Internet access in the room ... . ! ! I found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist . <stop>
<s> I stayed in this hotel during a business trip , and while <unknown> a business meeting in the hotel bar , a customer <unknown> all of the cash out of my <unknown> . Security was informed , but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them . After about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait <unknown> would never be able to report the incident , despite the fact that I was a hotel guest . Unfortunately I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait . <unknown> story short , I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone , anyone would have <unknown> to me about it . I 've since been on the phone with a manager , who promised to call me back once she <unknown> the incident , and have yet to hear back , despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago . I expected more from this hotel . <stop>
<s> They <unknown> about their beds but the beds were average . On <unknown> room seemed clean , however , <unknown> my <unknown> behind <unknown> and discovered at least an inch of dust . It appeared there had been <unknown> to something where they had to cut away part of the wall . The <unknown> job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole . <unknown> to have a decent shower or bath . <unknown> water saving <unknown> on both the shower and tub provided basically a <unknown> of water . I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor . Also be prepared to be <unknown> and <unknown> to <unknown> . There was even a $ 10 charge if you used the <unknown> in the room , really ! For room service they <unknown> on a delivery charge and a 20 % gratuity . Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he <unknown> a gratuity . I have already been charged for him to deliver the food . The parking fees were <unknown> at $ <unknown> a night but to add insult they charge a hotel <unknown> the same fees as the general public . Upon <unknown> to leave we realized that the <unknown> set my son had brought was missing . I reported the <unknown> to the hotel . Had to file a report with security who promised me they would <unknown> and get back to me within 2 days . It has now been over two weeks . No follow up , no apology even given . We will never stay at this hotel again . We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at . <stop>
<s> My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott . The room was spacious , comfortable and well-appointed . The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby . <unknown> and towels <unknown> . Free Wi-Fi in the room . The location is terrific , just one block to Michigan Avenue . We will stay here on future visits . <stop>
<s> We always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers when we take our kids to the city . You ca n't beat the location which is in walking distance of Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . The hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous <unknown> & <unknown> , a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a <unknown> breakfast . The hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds . My kids enjoy the pool with it 's windows that <unknown> the Chicago river . <stop>
<s> Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed . Check-in was quick , easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time . We were given a <unknown> room with two bathrooms which was <unknown> . It made getting ready to go out much <unknown> ! The hotel location is great opposite the park , which is a must see . Although located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave. Would also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping . For breakfast I would recommend <unknown> a muffin , croissant or <unknown> from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant . For evening <unknown> Kitty <unknown> is a must . <unknown> Irish bar with good drinks and live music . Finally the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever . I would have taken it home if I could ! <unknown> made for a good nights sleep . <stop>
<s> Great building and location , but ... staff is indifferent , you have to pay for WiFi ( after $ 300 <unknown> I would expect at least free WiFi ) , no pool in the building and something I found really annoying is that , if you move anything from the minibar , they have <unknown> that automatically charge you . This is <unknown> iPod dock in the room did n't work . Also , we had to move <unknown> between beds and found dirt all over . Definitely is not value for your money . You 're just paying for the Hard Rock brand . I will never go back to a Hard Rock Hotel . <stop>
<s> My wife and I decided to spend three days in Chicago last summer , and booked via Expedia . When we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its ' <unknown> . It 's like something out of Europe . We were able to get a free room upgrade , even though the rooms are still a bit small , but its ' an old hotel in an old city . It 's there for sleeping and <unknown> . The restaurants , <unknown> , and shops were all <unknown> . The next time we travel to Chicago , I 'll be <unknown> to stay anywhere other than the Palmer House Hilton <stop>
<s> We loved our stay at the Talbott . We were in Chicago to attend the theater show <unknown> <unknown> . We booked our room through <unknown> and received a nice discount . When we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy . We were upgraded to a King bed suite . The suite was well decorated and spacious . My wife <unknown> enjoyed the heat that could be <unknown> at the marble floor in the bathroom . We loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago . Highly recommended . <stop>
<s> In a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood . A small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby , the Pump Room is a classic place to have a drink . We did not have dinner there so I can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood . It is a short walk to very good shopping and eating . <stop>
<s> I was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the <unknown> in <unknown> . The decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not <unknown> . <unknown> disappointment was the <unknown> internet connection in the room . The wireless was very slow and the <unknown> from the wall did not work at all . I did request a <unknown> of the wall <unknown> , but it did no help . This hotel can do better than this . With a 5 star rating , it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered -- but , was just a mediocre experience for me . Even the bed covers were not that special . <unknown> more <unknown> management . Next time , I will try the Trump facility Thanks <stop>
<s> <unknown> traveler who is <unknown> to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth : eventually the <unknown> <unknown> . But you do not expect the price to double and <unknown> at the same time ! I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades . Yes , changes have been made , like the updated heating and <unknown> <unknown> and the front entrance , most recently . But other things have gone <unknown> . For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service . <unknown> have <unknown> and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions . This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within <unknown> distance of The Talbott , but not this <unknown> <unknown> . I , personally , am shopping for a new home away from home . <stop>
<s> <unknown> at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute , budget <unknown> weekend trip for my husband and me . We got a great rate -- $ 70 -- on Priceline . Close to the subway ( red line ) and we got from O'Hare to the hotel in less than an hour for $ <unknown> for both of us . We were able to check in more than 4 hours early . Room was great -- very clean , good closet space and fantastic bedding . Had one expensive drink at the Irish bar , but the bartender 's advice on restaurants and <unknown> to check out made it worth the price . Concierge was helpful , too . Overall , service was terrific , room was great and staying there was a treat . I would stay there again any time , especially at that price . <stop>
<s> Stayed here on business a few nights and really liked it . Very attractive , classy and comfortable hotel that 's got an <unknown> of <unknown> and <unknown> . <unknown> <unknown> are very nice , with an open area bar in the front lobby and nice sitting areas . Rooms are lovely as well , with <unknown> fixtures and furniture , a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed . Bathroom amenities and fixtures are sleek and attractive as well . Best of all , the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the water - both the river and the lake . If you 're working in the area , it 's the best choice for that part of town , and I prefer it to the nearby Hyatt and Monaco . <stop>
<s> My <unknown> and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel . The <unknown> people on the staff were the bell boys . They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay . The rest of the staff however was terrible . When we first checked in , I was instantly <unknown> . The front desk person was not in a good <unknown> and I could n't wait to leave the lobby . Having not traveled here before we were looking for <unknown> places to eat and to go sightseeing . We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations . We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff . At one point , the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her , as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well . Even though she saw us standing there , after she <unknown> with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first . Yes , we are in our <unknown> 20 's , but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are <unknown> . For how much money we paid for each night , I would have rather stayed somewhere else . We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews , but we did not experience any of this during our stay . The rooms were alright , but nothing special . I would not stay in this hotel again . <stop>
<s> This hotel is a <unknown> literally falling <unknown> and a staff that is both rude and <unknown> , <unknown> the lack of security and the <unknown> of the <unknown> amenities . The `` fitness center '' is an <unknown> closet ! We were <unknown> during our stay ! <unknown> anticipated `` warm , Irish hospitality '' and short of a <unknown> , no one was Irish , warm or <unknown> ! Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk <unknown> was incredibly rude when we made a simple request . <unknown> manager ( ? ) <unknown> to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us . Room was pretty at first glance but when <unknown> drawers fell out and the major construction of the <unknown> next door began at <unknown> it is not the kind of experience anyone could <unknown> . To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to <unknown> ! The manager that finally called us back was soooo <unknown> and <unknown> that we would have <unknown> no call at all . The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the <unknown> . <stop>
<s> This is an older hotel , and the age shows . Rooms are small , and a bit <unknown> . Bathroom in my room was in <unknown> need of upgrade . <unknown> was comfortable , though , and the room was quiet , Hotel staff was polite , but not really interested in the guest . Even the concierge was <unknown> . Check-in was <unknown> slow for the few number of people in line . Really , a hotel <unknown> promises so much in its <unknown> <unknown> should deliver better . The hotel really didnt seem to be trying . <stop>
<s> The thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable . The room was very clean , the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot . Other than that it was a great place to stay . <stop>
<s> My friend book this hotel for us for a girls weekend in Chicago . <unknown> just say we were <unknown> we did n't have to spend much time in the room . The carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way . The furniture was worn and outdated . The place was gross and just was n't worth the money we spent on it . The only redeeming quality was the door man , we was very nice and helpful . <stop>
<s> everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money , they have excellent customer service , the employees there really cared about their guests , there was always coffee , tea , hot chocolate in the lobby , good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer , the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions , the room did the job , there was a kitchen , 2 flat screen tv 's , and a <unknown> couch included , it was close to the `` <unknown> '' , but for us we found the <unknown> to be more useful . I would recommend getting a pass , we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $ 14 which we got at <unknown> <unknown> , not too far from the hotel , for the most part the <unknown> of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families , but us three girls did n't mind , so i would definitely recommend this place , it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels . <stop>
<s> <unknown> hotel , our room overlooked Michigan Ave and we could see the river . Very stylish , trendy room and hotel . <unknown> a bit in amenities ( pool , etc ) but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel . Booked it thought Hotwire for $ 99 which was awesome value . <stop>
<s> At the last minute , my son and I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago to see the <unknown> . After checking Priceline I decided to book the Omni because of the great price for <unknown> and hotel . We arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready ( I had called ahead and requested early arrival ) <unknown> front desk treated us like we were there best <unknown> friendly and accomodating . The room was wonderful with all the modern <unknown> you would expect in an upscale hotel . The room was spotless and the bed was VERY comfortable . There was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous <unknown> those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room ! ! ! We then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch . Our service was great as was the food . We also tried several restaurants around the <unknown> within walking distance . The service , cleanliness and location of the Omni were incredible . We will definitely go back . <stop>
<s> I have never experienced terrible service like this especially at such a highly <unknown> hotel . I had booked the hotel room for my parents for their anniversary weekend and stopped by earlier in the week to have the charge for the room put on my card as a gift . When my parents arrived , they were told that the front desk staff was new and did not complete the charge correctly . My parents then had to charge their own anniversary trip . <unknown> , my <unknown> had requested a non-smoking room to stay in and was reassured 3 times that his room was non-smoking . When my parents got to the room it <unknown> of smoke and there was an <unknown> and <unknown> on the desk <unknown> . When my <unknown> <unknown> down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my <unknown> wanted him to come up and <unknown> the <unknown> and <unknown> - something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was non-smoking . NEVER AGAIN . <stop>
<s> We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010 , 4th of July weekend . I was very <unknown> about leaving my <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with the valet at Amalfi . It has a few <unknown> to the <unknown> and can be <unknown> if not <unknown> correctly . I explained the <unknown> to the valet <unknown> , and felt like it was a complete waste of time . When the <unknown> was returned to me the valet <unknown> did not let it <unknown> down and cool the <unknown> off as I had <unknown> . When I tried to start it , it was n't happy , but did finally start . I was so <unknown> to get it back I just wanted to leave . <unknown> away I noticed that the top speed <unknown> on the <unknown> was <unknown> ! ! ! ( previous top speed was <unknown> , done a few days earlier <unknown> across South <unknown> ) . I could just picture the flying <unknown> scene in <unknown> <unknown> 's Day <unknown> . I could n't imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast , though it would n't take long to make that happen ( see <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> above ) . A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a <unknown> in the front <unknown> . I contacted the hotel and was <unknown> to their <unknown> people . No <unknown> . <unknown> learned . <unknown> <stop>
<s> This hotel was not worth it . From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out , the staff were rude and <unknown> . Rooms were only <unknown> , and certainly did not live up to the <unknown> <unknown> on the website . The bathroom <unknown> and sliding door were odd and <unknown> . The <unknown> centre ' was tiny and poor . We would not come here again . <stop>
<s> Just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high <unknown> construction next door the Swissotel Chicago is the one for you . My wife and I went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door , this year there is a loud construction site next door . So 8 am Saturday morning you will hear the workers starting . I am sure once the summer in Chicago comes around they will work all night . Just think as they keep <unknown> floors you will be able to look the workers in the <unknown> and <unknown> from your room that used to have a view of the Navy Pier . Now you will get an up close and personal view of people <unknown> concrete . On top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own . The front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the <unknown> that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was . The <unknown> were there because the Swissotel <unknown> a company to <unknown> their sound system that does not <unknown> <unknown> workers . If you ask the workers about the noise and they say we ca n't hear it . I am sure the Swissotel does not want word getting out about this . If you <unknown> on trying it for yourself do n't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck . <stop>
<s> I stayed here for 2 nights in <unknown> <unknown> . I have to say the hotel was exceptionally clean and very modern and funky . They had a free wine tasting each evening ! The restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay . The hotel is located within walking distance to the <unknown> system and also close to shopping / restaurants and sights ! Rooms were lovely , <unknown> the bathroom was slightly on the <unknown> side . Will be back . <stop>
<s> My <unknown> and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro ! The room was so small . The bathroom was <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> you use the sink you would <unknown> water on yourself . <unknown> one person at time in the bathroom , it was like being in an <unknown> 's bathroom . The walls are so thin , we heard the people across hall having <unknown> . The some staff were really rude . I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out . Check out time is <unknown> or 12 and we got a know on the door at <unknown> with the sign stating `` do not <unknown> `` The hotel did not have any <unknown> in their rooms , no mini fridge , and no coffee maker either . NO <unknown> to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny . We were there for four days and three nights , so we had three <unknown> cases full of clothes and no places to store them at . I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost <unknown> to park our car . My <unknown> and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again ! ! ! <stop>
<s> My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from <unknown> who were <unknown> in the City . We were excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading the reviews here , but really disappointed in the <unknown> . The web site has a photo of the 18 story building that <unknown> the hotel . It does n't state that the hotel only <unknown> the first 6 floors of the building . The rest are <unknown> . Our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a <unknown> brick wall about 16 feet <unknown> . The room itself was <unknown> , with standard furnishings <unknown> to a Holiday Inn . Although it is close to the best part of the City , it is tucked behind the new Trump Tower and <unknown> on a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> . Our <unknown> friends , by <unknown> , stayed on the <unknown> floor of Swissotel and had views of the Lake and Navy Pier . <stop>
<s> <unknown> great with a few <unknown> of relatively minor problems . First the good : <unknown> of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter <unknown> , as <unknown> the <unknown> . The restaurant service was absolutely <unknown> ( servers who do n't write <unknown> because they are expected to remember them , remember clients clearly from one day to the other , and go above and beyond <unknown> ) . Rooms are comfortable : yes the beds are great ! The gym is well <unknown> . Second the slightly off putting : <unknown> ... we got the `` I love chocolate package '' which <unknown> : <unknown> every day , dinner once , snack once and ... a gift . And we have an <unknown> favorite guest membership , which also <unknown> `` a gift '' . So , no gift ... either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership . Upon <unknown> , `` the snack was the gift '' . Not at all what the package suggested . That said , <unknown> was <unknown> and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well . Some problems at checkout though : we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but <unknown> less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem . Would absolutely go back , but probably not on a special package . <stop>
<s> We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel . Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor , but it was <unknown> with <unknown> corporate events for the entire duration of our stay . We did - as recommended - have a drink <unknown> only to be highly <unknown> by their bartender there . There is no breakfast buffet - you order a <unknown> <unknown> . <unknown> that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet . Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival - we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order . We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience . I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel . <stop>
<s> My family booked five <unknown> at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming <unknown> break . We took advantage of a pre-paid , <unknown> offer . We <unknown> received a `` <unknown> & Breakfast '' offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire <unknown> we could switch our reservation ( same <unknown> , different offer ) . We called the 800 ' number and the customer services representative was so <unknown> condescending and <unknown> , we simply hung up . We had been looking forward to our vacation , but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel . I should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the Ritz , the Four Seasons , and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way . I will post again after our stay on April <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I <unknown> the Talbott after 3 hrs <unknown> hotels online . We have had wonderful experiences with <unknown> ( Monaco , Allegro ) and <unknown> this would be comparable . Good points : the lobby is beautiful , and one staff member took <unknown> I <unknown> for my wife and arranged them nicely . The many problems : When my wife called with a question on our arrival day , the agent could find no reservation -- 15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly . When we arrived , the lobby was <unknown> with <unknown> ; nobody tried to <unknown> the group , several of whom <unknown> ahead to the check-in desk . We left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less <unknown> . We finally were checked in , after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk <unknown> for rooms . When we got there , our room had not been made up from the last guest . When we complained , we were given an `` upgrade '' to a room that was old and <unknown> . <unknown> are <unknown> , closet <unknown> are <unknown> , the air conditioner is noisy , and a wall <unknown> is <unknown> . The view is of a construction site . <unknown> are dated . We expect this from a budget hotel , not one <unknown> itself as elegant and upscale . When we returned after an evening out , the card <unknown> to open the main doors did not work . One staff member <unknown> us ( really ) for not using the <unknown> , when in fact we had tried . This was <unknown> , as others were standing in the lobby . I tried to access the hotel 's wifi <unknown> , but was only given a $ <unknown> upgrade option . I called the desk , and was told to `` <unknown> past it '' , which of course did nothing . It was n't until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked . We are pretty <unknown> ; we love good treatment and tip <unknown> . If we had only <unknown> 2 problems , we would n't write . In fact , we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right . The <unknown> wrote a letter , and suggested others at the hotel would be in touch ... nobody ever was . <stop>
<s> <unknown> all , my trip was great ; I got to spend time with my best friend . We did some shopping and site seeing . Trip was overall great . The only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at . Some of the walls had wall paper missing , most of the <unknown> <unknown> , there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms , some of the furniture had very <unknown> stains , the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom . we stayed in the corner suite on the <unknown> floor room <unknown> . <unknown> what ones <unknown> for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity . I do not plan on staying there again . <unknown> from the trip was great ! [ ] <stop>
<s> Stayed here as a treat to myself while in Chicago recently for a concert . I totally LOVED <unknown> here ! ! When you called either the Front Desk or Room Service , the phone was answered with `` <unknown> <unknown> ( <unknown> ) '' which was a great personal touch . <unknown> at the front desk , went out her way to help me - <unknown> some things in a safe for me before I could book into my room . My room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious . I was on the <unknown> floor and the views were superb . We ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice . The doormen were great too and I <unknown> <unknown> and a <unknown> one day and they still opened the door for me , so no <unknown> there . Comfortable , cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom , the lights went on in the <unknown> ( never seen that before ! ! ) , tv was <unknown> ready and flat screen . The bed was like sleeping on a <unknown> - best sleep for a while . Would I stay here again ? ? Oh yeah ! ! No problem - just need to save up first ! ! <stop>
<s> Upon check in - the lobby was <unknown> ! I was tired and not feeling well from a tough road show . The Front Desk person I checked in with was so fast and so nice that I walked away from the desk smiling ... that alone was such a great feeling . Every time I had any experience with a hotel staff member , I was so pleased ! I have to say - service really is everything to me and I have to give this top <unknown> for that . An added bonus was the location ... I just think it is perfect for me . On top of that , I had a meeting down in the loop , but not quite sure how to get there - a person <unknown> me in the lobby , asked if he could help me get to my meeting . I thought he was getting me a taxi - but no - he walked me to his <unknown> and drove me to the meeting , `` just a free service from the hotel '' he stated as we drove ... really ! ! ! ! so cool ! I have n't even <unknown> about the Pump Room yet - great dinner , very professional service , and no attitude . I will return - just up date the rooms a little bit , <unknown> all ... the curtains need some help . <stop>
<s> My in-laws booked a one night stay for New <unknown> <unknown> for the two of us to stay at the James . To be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will <unknown> us from returning and <unknown> our friends not to stay there . 1 ) <unknown> construction of room fixtures : ceiling light was missing leaving a <unknown> hole with <unknown> exposed , <unknown> towel <unknown> fell off the wall without being <unknown> , and bathroom door often came off it 's sliding <unknown> with <unknown> use . 2 ) When we reported these problems , employees simply put the towel <unknown> back on the wall without properly <unknown> them to the wall . 3 ) Upon check-out , they did not have record of my in-laws paying for our stay , though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us . We had to pay for our ( $ 300 ) gift and the in-laws were extremely upset . When we wrote a letter to management ( as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left ) we did not receive an adequate apology . <stop>
<s> I booked this via Priceline , and was not sure I 'd like it , as some <unknown> have fallen off the <unknown> . This hotel absolutely <unknown> my expectations . Despite booking with Priceline , I was treated like a king . They let me check in early , gave me a beautiful room , and even went so far as to look up my Starwood number so I could get some credit for the stay . The staff was <unknown> pleasant , the property immaculate , and the room very comfortable . I highly recommend this hotel . <stop>
<s> This hotel is <unknown> on the Hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and <unknown> . Although <unknown> as a three star the prices do not <unknown> this . It was more expensive than other four star hotels in the <unknown> , The breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded . All in all the worst hotel we stayed at in a 14 day tour of <unknown> and the <unknown> . Would not stay there again . <stop>
<s> I have n't stayed all that much with Hyatt and I 'm not sure if I will be going back anytime soon . The staff was very professional and helpful . Our room was close to being 4 <unknown> ; however , fell a little short . It really is time for a <unknown> of the bathroom . The toilet was of an older and <unknown> design where you had to close the <unknown> to flush . I 'm not a <unknown> <unknown> or anything ; however , I really do n't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I do n't have to . The hotel was fully booked with a <unknown> convention ( <unknown> ) and unfortunately for anyone else we all <unknown> for it . The noise at night from every <unknown> . The only way to <unknown> it was as if every room around us was having a <unknown> party . <unknown> back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic .

<s> Very Very noisy - <unknown> water running through <unknown> . It was terrible ! ! There are much better hotels to stay at in Chicago . <unknown> parking rate is <unknown> ( $ <unknown> a night ) and way too far out to walk to much . If you must stay here , try to park for free on dead end street ( <unknown> <unknown> on <unknown> ) and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a <unknown> grocery store for <unknown> . ( A can of soda at the hotel was $ <unknown> plus 18 % <unknown> fee ! ! ) <stop>
<s> <unknown> speaking , nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue . We checked the closed with the mini bar ( picture <unknown> ) , so much dust , nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years . We called in housekeeping , giving them the <unknown> to check and do something about it . <unknown> the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs . later . Next day moved to a renovated room , much better but not 5 star clean at all . In addition , there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception , no <unknown> when just 1/3 of the <unknown> is actually open . <unknown> do something about these issues its <unknown> everything ! <stop>
<s> I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online <unknown> . After booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds . I was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds . When I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests . Apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed . The staff was completely <unknown> . To add insult to <unknown> we met other guests that had <unknown> a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in . I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . The customer service is well below what is <unknown> . The location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago . <unknown> line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker ! ! ! <stop>
<s> went to chicago for a week in may , decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton , we were not disapointed . perhaps it was <unknown> there were quite a few <unknown> going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got <unknown> to <unknown> level . we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each . they beds and pillows were too <unknown> for , so so comfy <unknown> the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles . all the staff were very helpful . a lot of guests seemed to <unknown> the staff especially the <unknown> maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful . about 2 blocks away on <unknown> is a cafe called `` <unknown> '' which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast , the cafe and the staff are <unknown> . expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning . <stop>
<s> I live in Chicago and have frequent <unknown> to recommend hotels to friends and business <unknown> . We recently put up a <unknown> ( and his family ) we were <unknown> for our company at the Conrad . We had had good luck with this hotel when it was a <unknown> <unknown> . It was a disappointment for all concerned as a Conrad . On the plus side , our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room . On the downside ... They learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub ( only a shower ) . Our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it , which they had to clean themselves . When the coffee bar had no <unknown> coffee and our guests asked for some , they were told it would be delivered immediately . When they called 30 minutes later the front desk <unknown> that they had `` forgotten . '' While the concierge and doorman were quite helpful , our guests told us that the front desk personnel were <unknown> and unresponsive . Our guests were generally under <unknown> by one of the `` five best hotels in Chicago . '' Conrad has a long way to go to <unknown> with the Four Seasons , Peninsula and Park Hyatt . <stop>
<s> We went to Chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at Homewood . My first impression was great , very helpful valet employees and VERY nice . That is one <unknown> of my stay here . Otherwise , we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has <unknown> floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the <unknown> room <unknown> due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up , the more beautiful the view is . So we got the 9th floor . Not what I call `` high up '' when the rooms started on floor 6 . Then the following morning , we went to breakfast of which was ok , nothing great . My husband and I went down in <unknown> and a <unknown> but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few <unknown> , some fruit , and that was it . So , we got our food and sat down . After getting <unknown> at for the first 15-20 minutes , an employee came and told us that we <unknown> allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on . <unknown> you , it was about 15-20 minutes after we had even <unknown> the room . So she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast . <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> we already had gotten our food . I am sure it is because very few employees could speak <unknown> <unknown> that it took so long . <unknown> but not least , dont come with a clean car . I had <unknown> my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned , it was filthy dirty . <stop>
<s> Stayed here in November <unknown> on a leisure trip to Chicago . Hotel is very dated , with some rooms that just are n't good enough . Front desk staff was rude . Will not be staying here again - prefer the Swissotel and the Hyatt properties ( Regency is <unknown> priced , and Park Hyatt is <unknown> more ) and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well ( Kimpton , etc ) . Pros : -The only hotel that <unknown> onto Michigan Avenue , very close to all of the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> Bar has a great selection of cheeses <unknown> are clean Cons : <unknown> hotel rooms just make no sense - our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a <unknown> ( <unknown> no view ) , and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall ( actually no view ) <unknown> have to pay for everything - internet , gym , and the pool ( which was not available due to renovation ... ) <unknown> hotel was very old , not in a <unknown> sense but in a <unknown> story one <unknown> desk staff was rude <stop>
<s> Stayed here for 3 nights for a <unknown> convention . No complaints . Room was great with a beautiful view . Staff was very accommodating . Had drinks and appetizers in main bar . Fantastic ! Great location . Yes it 's a huge hotel as it 's used for <unknown> but that did n't stop it from being a great place . <stop>
<s> Just returned from a week in Chicago with the family . This hotel was perfect for us . Location is great , kids loved the pool as a place to <unknown> down after a day of museums , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , etc . We checked in through Hilton Honors Desk as <unknown> to the regular check in line . Even though our reservations were through priceline at a reduced rate , they gave us a pick of the the rooms . The room had a large closet which helped with the amount of <unknown> we had with us . Used valet parking which was <unknown> . We had a great experience and would stay there again . <stop>
<s> While the James was once considered an elegant , chic <unknown> , it has lost its <unknown> . The small rooms are filled with cheap <unknown> type furnishings , Our tiny bathroom <unknown> with water that <unknown> the shower <unknown> . <unknown> and <unknown> from neighboring rooms sounded more like <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . The 2 small elevators could not handle the guests , and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended <unknown> of time . The thin windows could not <unknown> street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night . It was rather <unknown> to listen to the couple next door <unknown> , but also rather <unknown> & <unknown> . It took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out . This hotel has lost it and the James <unknown> will have a difficult time <unknown> in New <unknown> 's <unknown> when they try to open in September . New <unknown> will not <unknown> shabby <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I have been <unknown> to write a review of the Omni but was n't sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high . We stayed here for 5 nights . The room was fine when I walked in . But about five minutes or so I was all <unknown> . <unknown> it might have been from the flight . I then noticed there was dust everywhere . The TV , the <unknown> , and worst of all the air vent . It was literally hanging off the vent . I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up . After 30 minutes of waiting and <unknown> other things . A bathroom door that would n't close , broken light fixtures , a <unknown> or <unknown> on the bed . broken bathroom fixtures . This place was a <unknown> . <unknown> the pictures will show some of it . I could go on and on . <unknown> <unknown> minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room , Both he and head of housekeeping were `` shocked '' at the room . We were moved to another room , not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked , or so I was told . I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed . But this will be the last time . <unknown> to say . The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay , but does n't explain how a hotel of this <unknown> let a room like this pass any <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I <unknown> to Chicago last week with my daughter for some <unknown> shopping . We booked the Conrad based on the reviews on <unknown> . It <unknown> up to all expectations . Great big room , with two king size beds . Very comfortable . Breakfast was great , <unknown> of choice and plenty on the plate . Great location , connected to a shopping mall which was very useful the day it <unknown> . All and all , a great hotel and we would go back in the morning . Chicago is a great city with very friendly people . <stop>
<s> Our stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant . We enjoyed the location . We could easily walk to the Red line or access the bus <unknown> along Michigan Avenue . We felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and <unknown> the fabulous <unknown> that is on <unknown> State Street and <unknown> . We walked to 3rd Coast Cafe , the Chicago <unknown> Museum , and Second City from our hotel . Our room was spacious and <unknown> , and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before <unknown> out again in the evening . We would choose to stay there again even if we could <unknown> more expensive locations downtown . We definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place . <stop>
<s> I had my wedding <unknown> and reception at the Sofitel . It seems as though I had the same experience as `` <unknown> <unknown> '' I read her review and thought `` that 's exactly what happened to me ! '' Here 's what happened : The good news : The actual event was great . Most <unknown> , the food was absolutely incredible ; I think almost every one of our guests has <unknown> to us about the food . The same goes for the cake , which was made by <unknown> the <unknown> . The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good . The bad news : Michelle , the Director of <unknown> , honestly made my wedding <unknown> process a <unknown> . While we were <unknown> the <unknown> , she promptly <unknown> to my <unknown> and phone calls ; after the <unknown> was <unknown> , it was a <unknown> <unknown> to get in touch with her to get my questions answered , to schedule the tasting , etc . She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email , and she <unknown> never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time . I <unknown> things would get better within the month -- or even the week -- prior to my wedding , but they actually got even worse . Michelle just could not get it <unknown> , and if it were n't for my wedding <unknown> 's <unknown> in <unknown> her to finally get things right , I do n't know what would have happened . <unknown> , if it were n't for Michelle 's <unknown> to do her job , I would have had a great experience . But , as it is , when I think back about my experience with the Sofitel , I unfortunately have very negative <unknown> . And that 's incredibly disappointing , considering it was a major part of the best night of my life . <stop>
<s> The service was reasonably well ... they seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily . The location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous <unknown> . It was interesting that the <unknown> I took at the hotel in order to <unknown> internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response `` <unknown> '' . My visit was anything but , <unknown> <unknown> to the fact that they put me on the second floor , facing the street . I <unknown> at 4 <unknown> and never did return to sleep because of the <unknown> street noise and <unknown> of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window . Not the most <unknown> for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting . At check-out when I informed the hotel clerk of my <unknown> he <unknown> and said , `` <unknown> , city noise . '' <stop>
<s> I just left the Conrad Chicago and have nothing but good things to say . We used Hilton points to stay there but paid $ <unknown> to upgrade to a junior suite . We were in room <unknown> . I would <unknown> people ask for an odd <unknown> room so that they will have a view looking north on Michigan Ave. Our room was very modern with 2 large <unknown> <unknown> tv and <unknown> 3 <unknown> sound system . 4 big windows that actually open . The bed <unknown> were very nice , the towels were OK . The room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub . <unknown> everywhere . <unknown> , slippers , etc . The work out room was good with different machines and some free weights . There are clean towels in the workout room too . We never ate in the hotel so I ca n't comment on the food or the prices . There is a Starbucks across the street ( Michigan ) and an <unknown> bar attached to the Nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel . It was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel . The location of the hotel could not be better . We were walking distance to everything . Every kind of shopping or <unknown> experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles . <unknown> all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain . <stop>
<s> My company booked our group for a <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> . The service was friendly , helpful and the property was beautiful . The hotel was clean and filled with history . We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the rate was reasonable as well . <stop>
<s> This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of <unknown> <unknown> . The entrance and lobby of the hotel <unknown> its class . The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none . It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park . It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile . For Blues <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> 's <unknown> Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel . Highly recommended . <stop>
<s> If you have not tried the Millennium Knickerbocker for a stay in Chicago , do it now ! We have stayed ( and enjoyed ) at the Drake , Intercontinental and others , but we always now come back to the Knickerbocker . Why ? If `` <unknown> '' the doorman is on duty and you pull up , he will welcome you . He 'll probably ask your name . Why ? Because he wants to call you by your name every time he will see you during your visit . <unknown> he even <unknown> the other employees know your name and all of a <unknown> , doorman , receptionist , bellman , waiter are <unknown> to you by name . The employees are what makes this hotel . Yes , it has everything to offer like all hotels , but the others do n't have the fine people ( including the cleaning staff ) these folks have . <unknown> it , you will like it . We look forward to our next visit already ... <stop>
<s> I only stayed at this hotel for one night , the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy . After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I <unknown> the <unknown> until the elevator arrived , never under 10 min . even late at night . I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband ... 1 <unknown> was $ 14 ! I <unknown> drinking because I 'm <unknown> so I had a soda water for $ 4 ... if I would have <unknown> I would have had <unknown> water . Overall ... great rooms , OK staff , horrible elevators , overpriced drinks . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference . I was very pleased with the hotel . The doorman offered me an umbrella as I headed out for a walk ... and sure enough it started to rain very soon <unknown> I would have been <unknown> with it . Upon my return , the doorman then asked about my walk , etc . This is <unknown> of all the staff I encountered . The front desk promptly checked me in . <unknown> register for their <unknown> program before you arrive ... The complimentary gym access is excellent , plus you save on internet access fees which are <unknown> for members . The bathroom and separate <unknown> areas were large and convenient . The only <unknown> no coffee maker ! AND the Starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate <unknown> are closed those days ! ! ! Otherwise my stay was perfect , considering the conference rate was $ 99 per night ! <stop>
<s> I booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the Magnificent Mile <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . I chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed . We arrived at our hotel around <unknown> PM to check in . We came at this time because the front desk <unknown> said that we could not check in until <unknown> PM . After giving him our name , the manager said , '' OK , we have your king smoking suite available '' . We quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room . He insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room . We went back and forth , then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation . Luckily , we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone . It clearly said non-smoking . After showing him our reservation , he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available . So why in the world did he need to see our reservation ! ! We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room . It <unknown> out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non <unknown> there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children . The manager eventually called around and found a <unknown> <unknown> near by with one bed . We <unknown> our room reservation . We live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home . My family was very disappointed . My husband is a <unknown> member with Hilton . Let 's just say we will be <unknown> back to Marriott . The hotel lobby was dated . The smoking room that I saw looked very dated as well . They made an error and never <unknown> up to it , nor did they do anything to <unknown> us for such a huge inconvenience . <stop>
<s> Room : I stayed in the <unknown> floor . 2 double bed room . The room has a decent size . <unknown> is state of the art . The <unknown> are stylish . Room <unknown> was very nice . I could have left my big suitcase opened throughout the stay ( which <unknown> happens in most hotels ; ) ) 42 '' <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> WiFi in the room The bed and pillows are of <unknown> quality which provided an excellent <unknown> sleep to me . Location <unknown> quite central . Shopping streets are in reach of 5 minutes by feet . Midway <unknown> is in reach by cab within 30 minutes ( <unknown> <unknown> ) . Service - <unknown> and Fitness <unknown> - though I did not use . - <unknown> ( not used ) - <unknown> <unknown> - Very friendly and helpful staff . ( even printed our boarding passes at the reception ) I do travel <unknown> , and do recommend this hotel for a business stay , as also for an overnight with friends going shopping , <unknown> whatever in the city center of Chicago . <unknown> was very <unknown> for <unknown> standard being provided at a downtown hotel . <stop>
<s> My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers in February . Everything about the hotel and experience was superb . The location was wonderful as well . Our room overlooked the river and we had a great view of the lake <unknown> Navy Pier . The best part of the stay was the `` sweet sleeper '' bed . It was so comfortable . The staff was friendly and helpful as well . Nothing bad to say about this Sheraton ! I will stay here again ! <stop>
<s> We just returned from our first trip to Chicago and stayed at the Omni . I read many reviews on trip <unknown> and picked the Omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on . The location , staff , rooms , amenities , etc were all wonderful . <unknown> thank you to TA members who suggested <unknown> up for the preferred member program . We did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and <unknown> <unknown> other <unknown> . I loved being <unknown> up to fresh <unknown> juice and the Chicago Tribune newspaper . We were in room <unknown> which was perfect . Corner suite with two out of the 3 sides of the rooms being windows with a great view . The room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma TV . The bathroom amenities were wonderful . I loved <unknown> in the tub with the <unknown> <unknown> that were provided . The turn down service was great as well . We would come back to our room with relaxing music <unknown> and our bed ready for us . We ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious . The <unknown> muffins were the best I have ever had . Everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly . The staff at the Omni is so accomodating . Everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is . Have to thank the concierge <unknown> and <unknown> . They were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and <unknown> for everything we wanted to do . I also used the gym during my stay and it was great . All the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a <unknown> TV attached . And the gym itself had two <unknown> . They also had cold <unknown> water for you after your workout . I am a <unknown> for cleanliness and it was <unknown> every morning . It really was a fantastic stay at the Omni and we would never stay anywhere else . I also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there . Everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed . Thank you Trip Advisor for another great trip <unknown> ! <stop>
<s> Stayed here October <unknown> through November 5 for a <unknown> . This is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect . The Art Institute and Millenium Park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel . My room was small , but beautiful . The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows . <unknown> , no coffee maker in the room ... The staff was helpful and friendly . I 'd stay here again ! <stop>
<s> This hotel was chosen by my husband 's company as the family came along for the business trip . The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and <unknown> from the <unknown> floor . My first <unknown> were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean . The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance , but was otherwise <unknown> Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long . <unknown> like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there . I had read from another <unknown> to <unknown> the Fairmont <unknown> 's club and wi-fi in the room would be free . We <unknown> up for the club , but were <unknown> as to why they do n't just offer everyone free wi-fi . Parking fees were <unknown> at $ <unknown> , but thankfully the company was paying for this . We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel . The hotel is NOT <unknown> in terms of restaurants or amenities . There is no swimming pool , but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door ( there is an underground <unknown> that <unknown> the Fairmont there ) . We loved the Swissotel 's pool on the 42nd floor . Fantastic views from the pool ! Although the beds were comfortable , my daughter and I were both <unknown> of bed bugs during our stay . Unfortunately we did n't know until the next day after we returned home . Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to <unknown> . My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our <unknown> to our <unknown> . The bites made you want to <unknown> your skin off ! My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all . <unknown> of room <unknown> -- bed <unknown> the bathroom ! ! !

<s> The Omni Chicago really <unknown> on all <unknown> , from the <unknown> of the rooms to the helpful staff to the <unknown> location on Michigan Avenue . While this address in Chicago <unknown> a high level of quality , the Omni <unknown> . Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes , the staff had <unknown> recommendations for dining and events , and the rooms are some of the largest you 'll find at this price range in Chicago . Even the `` standard '' room has a separate living area and work desk . The fitness center has free weights , <unknown> machines , and two <unknown> of <unknown> equipment . I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way ! All in all , a great property ! <stop>
<s> We got a <unknown> deal at this hotel for $ 99 a night . It 's in a good location to the Loop . Excellent transportation options <unknown> . My <unknown> comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a `` <unknown> '' room . It overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us . The toilet in the room was not <unknown> to the floor . Other than that , if I needed to stay in the Loop again for something and I knew I was n't going to be put in a <unknown> room , I would stay here again . <stop>
<s> I stayed at The Talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased . The staff was friendly as can be immediately <unknown> the <unknown> of the <unknown> . I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious . The free wi-fi came in handy as I needed to work <unknown> while there . Everything from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay . Oh , and I got to workout at the huge <unknown> right next door for free . <stop>
<s> This hotel is the perfect location for downtown Chicago shopping . The only thing is the pool is extremely small - it is <unknown> , but looks much larger on the website . <stop>
<s> We recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel for a week . The hotel was in a wonderful location and the service was great . We found all of the staff very helpful and prompt . We highly recommend the Intercontinental for any travel needs <unknown> it be for business or pleasure . <stop>
<s> took a weekend trip with my wife . got a great rate with valet included , paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room . staff was nice , workout facility was great . room has current decor , but was starting to show some wear . watch the concierge , she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us . <stop>
<s> As a frequent traveler to Chicago , I generally stay at the Sutton <unknown> , but thought I would try a different boutique hotel . I will never stay at this hotel again . The first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a <unknown> closet , leaving me absolutely <unknown> ! <unknown> the <unknown> hotel room I 've been in in the <unknown> ! I complained to the front desk , who then moved me to a `` premium '' room -- still quite small , but <unknown> so . The bathroom was tiny , without a <unknown> , making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room . The location leaves much to be desired , as my room looked out directly onto the El ( elevated subway - <unknown> noise ) , and the street was pretty <unknown> on a Sunday evening . I will say that the free wi-fi was great . If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan <unknown> , I 'd highly recommend you take that . If you want a nice room in a great location , check out Sutton Place hotel instead . <stop>
<s> <unknown> prior to my <unknown> reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light , facing an open view , not a close building . ( The reservation was made through a conference travel <unknown> . ) I confirmed my request by <unknown> a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record . She told me it would be difficult to find , but <unknown> a <unknown> and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me . I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers , tucked into a very dark corner , facing a wall of rooms . I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request , but to `` sit tight '' and someone would call me . No one did . <unknown> calls <unknown> similar <unknown> . At one point I was told I could have a `` <unknown> room , '' with a sofa bed , at a reduced rate , but I could not go see the room before <unknown> to moving . That 's real hospitality for you . <unknown> that a bad sofa bed could be worse than <unknown> in a <unknown> , I ended up staying in the <unknown> dark room . ( I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds . ) The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms . Other than that , it was tight <unknown> with a tiny closet , two uncomfortably low chairs , at the desk and in a ( dark ) corner . <unknown> fixtures did n't do much to <unknown> things up . Since I was here at a conference , I really wanted a bright <unknown> to wake up early and start the <unknown> in and to have as a cheerful office for <unknown> calls and e-mail , but instead I got a <unknown> . <unknown> , I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago , conference or not , I will absolutely stay at another hotel . There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the <unknown> of `` inside tower '' rooms , places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service . <unknown> on the Chicago Hilton . <stop>
<s> After some <unknown> I booked the Sofitel Water Tower Place for a 3 night <unknown> in June . This was my first visit to Chicago and it turned out that we had a really great time . We loved our rooms , which were just the basic type on the lower floors but they were very well appointed . The decor is modern and personally I liked it a lot . The rooms were pleasant and <unknown> and the bed extremely comfortable . The hotel location is just perfect , close to the shops on <unknown> Avenue , and the beach at <unknown> Street . Lovely restaurants close by and nightlife in Rush Street is just steps away . The area although <unknown> was <unknown> and quiet . We could walk to most places and I would not hesitate to stay here again . The hotel staff very helpful , always smiling and ready to help ; from the doormen to the helpful lady at <unknown> . I would not hesitate at all to stay at Sofitel Water Tower Place next time I 'm in Chicago ; in fact I look forward to my next visit . <stop>
<s> We really enjoyed our brief stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker ! From the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender , everyone we met was helpful and welcoming . Our <unknown> room was clean and beautiful , and the view looking north to the Drake Hotel and <unknown> across the street was nice . The in-room coffee service was appreciated , too . There is n't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries , but I 'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with <unknown> over a <unknown> room any day ! <stop>
<s> We were disappointed with this hotel . The staff seems <unknown> and unhelpful . Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests . The <unknown> in the hallway blew <unknown> air , but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it . The lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit . The room and bed was comfortable , but the cream and and modern art work are not our style . The room <unknown> many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer . <unknown> not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago . <stop>
<s> The location was good . Check-in was ok . <unknown> for non smoking room , given floor with half smoking half non smoking . We could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened . We asked for and <unknown> a room on a non-smoking floor . They did not bring up the key , we had to go down to the lobby to get it . Breakfast could have had some <unknown> choices , the sweet <unknown> and <unknown> were not fresh . <unknown> not <unknown> . Room only had ONE wash <unknown> , had to call down for more . <unknown> NEVER showed up at our room . Not for turndown service , not for the morning clean <unknown> . Called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were <unknown> of putting our the Do Not <unknown> sign . They said they would come up and they never came when they said they would . We finally told them not to come because of the time . We wanted to get ready to go out for dinner . Never greeted by anyone as we came and went . I have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham . The Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed <unknown> will NEVER stay at this hotel again , Not worth <unknown> a night <stop>
<s> My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite . When we arrived , she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested -- and more . Our suite had a <unknown> view of the lake ! ! ! And , we were able to check in early . The service at this hotel is incredible . Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had . The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel , very near to Michigan Avenue . <unknown> was prompt and <unknown> . We really could n't have asked for a better hotel . We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there . <stop>
<s> Hotel Monaco is in a really great location , only a block away from the <unknown> mile and a couple of blocks from Millenium Park . <unknown> Tower is also well within walking distance and if you do n't mind walking you wo n't have a problem walking to <unknown> Town and <unknown> Park ( we did ) . The daily , complimentary , wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out . If you can , leave your car behind , you wo n't need it and the parking is quite pricey , which is not very surprising considering the location . Everything was clean , fresh and modern and the staff very helpful . The only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around `` the loop '' was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid 's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning . <stop>
<s> Very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel . I travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel . I reserved a king bed . At checkin I was informed they were out of <unknown> and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade . When i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and <unknown> all night . The TV did not work . Had to call for service . The following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced . Stay somewhere else . <stop>
<s> We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite . Location is superb , staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being <unknown> . <unknown> , at the front desk , is <unknown> helpful as is the concierge . We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you <unknown> the frequent guest program , high speed internet is <unknown> , as is a breakfast <unknown> delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing . <unknown> is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing <unknown> curtains ! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel . <stop>
<s> This comes a little late as I 'm finally <unknown> up on my reviews from the past several months : ) A <unknown> friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late October 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town . This hotel is perfect , <unknown> . <unknown> check in and check out . Lovely , clean , comfortable rooms with great views of the city . I know this area pretty well and it 's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions . We had dinner and went <unknown> with our friends around <unknown> <unknown> We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there 's even public transportation right near by but we did n't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel . Parking , as is usual for Chicago , was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly ( however , we left on a Sunday morning , not exactly a high traffic time although it was a <unknown> <unknown> day , so a bit <unknown> than usual I would think ) . No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $ 100 through Hotwire , a <unknown> steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel . <stop>
<s> We just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel . We really have nothing bad or negative to say about it . We 've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt , The Peninsula , and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel <unknown> them all . It 's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices . It 's a beautiful hotel all the way around . Staff is <unknown> friendly without being <unknown> . They were helpful with the one small problem we had and <unknown> it quickly . The common areas are fresh and modern in <unknown> . The room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed <unknown> baths . My wife loved the huge tub . We had breakfast via <unknown> every morning and it was always hot and delicious . The robes and <unknown> at turndown was always appreciated . The property is <unknown> situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk . <unknown> a <unknown> or <unknown> ? They 're all close by . This was our second stay since it opened and I 'm sure it 's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago . <stop>
<s> Not worth the price . We almost stayed at a hotel for $ <unknown> a night , but instead choose the Hard Rock for $ <unknown> ( a special ) . We were located on the `` newly renovated '' <unknown> floor . The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced . Upon entering our room we found some cool <unknown> <unknown> along with a <unknown> foot <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . I think they were <unknown> done <unknown> <unknown> the room . At checkout they tried to charge us $ 11 for using the mini-bar which we did n't even open . They removed the charge right away but I <unknown> if they try to get <unknown> people with that charge . Nothing special here . If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light <unknown> then this is the place for you . <stop>
<s> So ... the location to the <unknown> train stop is great ... and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel . The wall are very thin ... so much you can hear <unknown> and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway . There is no coffee maker in the room , however ; free coffee is available in the lobby ... <unknown> everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning ? ? ? Finally , the `` business center '' is a pay for use set-up ... no <unknown> internet <unknown> or <unknown> . <unknown> ... they bathroom is <unknown> and <unknown> in <unknown> and comfort . <stop>
<s> Great hotel in a wonderful location . I stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and I loved it . I could n't recommend it highly enough . <unknown> popular and busy , the staff were still helpful . The rooms were lovely and spacious and clean . <unknown> were clean , bright and spacious also . I 'd definitely recommend this hotel too , it 's close to the <unknown> mile . <stop>
<s> our stay was absolutely perfect . its a cool hotel to look at , the design and feel is very trendy and hip . all the staff are terrific , especially the consierge <unknown> <unknown> and attitude . our room was on the top floor , with great views . super comfy bed , and neat bathroom . fantastic , choose this with no hesitation ! <stop>
<s> We ate at the Prime House restaurant last year , that is why we picked the hotel . <unknown> year the food and service at the Prime House was outstanding . This year the service felt rushed . The <unknown> even asked why we were eating so early . It was <unknown> . Our room in the hotel felt cramped . The beds were comfortable . The bathroom had maintenance problems . The maid service and turndown out night was good . All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful . I just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying . <stop>
<s> I can only confirm the <unknown> reviews previously mentioned . We stayed in room <unknown> , King with River <unknown> . No noise and very <unknown> price was a bargain at $ <unknown> a night . I would stay here again . The `` L '' from Midway <unknown> <unknown> you off about two blocks from the Hotel . It 's a $ 2 ride - no need for a $ 40 taxi ride . <stop>
<s> I stayed here August 20 through 23rd with my <unknown> year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel . The price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on Michigan Avenue . The front desk and concierge service was excellent and <unknown> our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities . The John <unknown> theme on our floor was a nice touch . <unknown> of you single <unknown> out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago really helped me <unknown> just that ! <stop>
<s> has gone <unknown> so much we almost checked out . We stayed in the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> Suite for 3 nights while <unknown> customers in Chicago . We 've stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula , it has always been a comfortable and clean , service <unknown> hotel . Not only has room service been eliminated ( if you want room service it comes from <unknown> Italian restaurant down the street , so is ONLY Italian ) , complimentary morning coffee is no longer available , mini bars have been removed from the rooms , etc . etc . The only restaurant , the Pump Room was closed for a <unknown> function on Saturday night , the bar also , so we were n't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests . <unknown> the function was planned before we made our reservations , but we were n't told of it . We also learned that the bell staff ( who have been there for 13 and 8 years ) is being eliminated . So , in other <unknown> , <unknown> to do with `` service '' is gone from this hotel . I hear they are going to begin renovations in December , but that is no excuse to let an old <unknown> `` go to <unknown> '' in the meantime . We wo n't be staying here when we go back in July or for <unknown> . We even had to pay for internet . Mind you , our bill for 3 nights was <unknown> , no room service , no <unknown> charges . <unknown> <unknown> for what you get <unknown> at the Ambassador East . <unknown> . <stop>
<s> The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best , and mediocre at worst . The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff . The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you . The room was <unknown> , however . The bathroom was in especially bad <unknown> . It was dirty when we arrived , with hair in the sink and shower . The shower was in really bad <unknown> . The shower head <unknown> did not work properly and water pressure was very low . The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit . The decor throughout the hotel ( lobby , hallways and rooms ) was very <unknown> and <unknown> . I would have liked there to have been a <unknown> machine in the hotel as well . The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use . The hotel 's location was okay though it was a bit of a <unknown> to the most popular tourist <unknown> . I would not stay at this hotel again based on its current <unknown> , but if it <unknown> some renovations to <unknown> the rooms and the bathrooms , I might be <unknown> to stay there again . ... read more <stop>
<s> Our trip was our <unknown> anniversary trip . The hotel did not honor my choice of king size bed . Instead we received two double beds . This seriously <unknown> our <unknown> of our stay at the Hyatt . There were two <unknown> of coffee complimentary in the room . No complimentary coffee <unknown> else in the very large hotel . Location was more of a business <unknown> , not <unknown> for pleasure trip . <unknown> of Hyatt were very friendly and helpful , other than the <unknown> to deliver the reserved room . <stop>
<s> at check in , the girl gave us a smoking room . we asked for <unknown> . i had to get another room . it was by the elevators . loud ! really loud ! . the new room did n't have a shower door . so every day water <unknown> on to the floor and wet the carpet . the public transportation is amazing . you do n't need a car in chicago . you can get anywhere by train or bus . it 's fast too . Area recommendations chicago is great ! good shopping , good food ( <unknown> east ! ! ! ) and great bars . the <unknown> that <unknown> out the windows in the <unknown> tower was really cool ! i loved being in the <unknown> rain <unknown> i 've ever seen ! <stop>
<s> I found this hotel in the `` Small <unknown> Hotels of the <unknown> '' <unknown> having stayed in many of these in recent years , and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels . I <unknown> chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from <unknown> . The Talbott was <unknown> located , although i had a view of a building site , and did have an ambience and some charm , however it was a little dirty and <unknown> around the <unknown> and the service was <unknown> . I had to wait in the <unknown> well after check in time , having previously attempted to check in earlier , tired and in need of a rest , while a `` final check '' was done to my room . The valet parking was not outside when requested , breakfast was not included in the price , all the things requested of reception did not <unknown> , and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special . I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant , where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel . I was severely disappointed and can not recommend it at all . <stop>
<s> When you 're standing in a <unknown> excuse for a shower <unknown> and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak <unknown> to a <unknown> to nothing coming out at all , nothing in the world will ever <unknown> you to stay here again . The worst part is that the hotel <unknown> this is a problem ( they told me that it happens to the upper floors , and I was n't even staying on the <unknown> floor ! ) as if that makes it ok . I can look past the `` <unknown> '' decor of the room and take it for what it is - an <unknown> place to <unknown> , but <unknown> , a girl 's got <unknown> shower . <stop>
<s> Overall the hotel is very nice . The rooms are spacious and well-appointed , but they <unknown> to be <unknown> or dated . My bathroom was particularly below average , with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a <unknown> showerhead . The toilet paper roll <unknown> was <unknown> out of the wall and its <unknown> were exposed . The conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant . I <unknown> it when they do <unknown> it makes me suspect they 're getting <unknown> from places that otherwise do n't get enough business on their own . Breakfast was very good . It 's a relatively large <unknown> spread . <stop>
<s> I stayed at Palmer House for one night in early January this year . During the check in , the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation . I did not bring the confirmation with me because I had not been asked to present it in other places during check <unknown> she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key . I did what she told me and went to the bell station . However , people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key . A bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk . I finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes . As other people <unknown> out before , the room I got was small and old with a <unknown> bed , and I could hear people next door using the bathroom . This was not a pleasant experience , even though I paid over 100 dollars to the hotel . <stop>
<s> The hotel is <unknown> by very nice but many <unknown> people . Executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours . Other areas <unknown> lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel . One of the <unknown> at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place . While the location is good , this particular hotel is simply not a good <unknown> of what Swissotel is supposed to be , and there are far better choices in Chicago . It would not be my choice for a return stay . <stop>
<s> This is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities . Everyone was helpful . The breakfast buffet was wonderful . The bed was `` just like home '' . We would definitely stay again . A nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home . It was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best . <stop>
<s> This hotel was great - In a great area right downtown and close to everything . The daily happy hour had great food , wine and premium <unknown> . The free breakfast was even better ! <unknown> I believe everything was included <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . Our room was a king size facing the back of the building . Really clean new and comfortable . Small touches such as <unknown> and <unknown> to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - Would highly recommend . <stop>
<s> Just putting in a good word for the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago . The reviews I read before going were <unknown> so we were not sure what to expect . The location was perfect . The hotel was beautiful . Our view was awesome . The room was large enough and very clean . The bed was very comfy . The staff were helpful - especially the concierge , <unknown> . I could n't find anything negative to say . If you want to stay in downtown Chicago - you ca n't go wrong with this cool hotel . <stop>
<s> I stayed here for 5 nights last summer . I booked the reservation on priceline for $ <unknown> which was the cheapest rate I could find anywhere during a convention week . <unknown> , when I arrived at 11 pm from the airport , I was told that they had <unknown> the hotel and had no room for me . They booked me at a <unknown> 2 star <unknown> by the airport . They gave me $ 20 for a taxi to get there , and it cost me $ 35 . I was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and <unknown> . The Millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their <unknown> . No free drink , no room upgrade , nothing . Since I booked on the internet , I was <unknown> <unknown> . <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I stayed there on October 6 , <unknown> . When I pulled the covers of my bed , there was a small dark <unknown> <unknown> the size of a <unknown> of <unknown> , which was either a bed bug or <unknown> . I <unknown> it under a glass ( see the attached pictures ) and called the front desk . The <unknown> person claimed it was a <unknown> . Absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem , <unknown> to follow through on promises they made to me . <unknown> aside the bug problem , I <unknown> that the windows are quite thin . We could hear a lot of the street noise , which made for a hard night 's sleep , not to mention <unknown> about <unknown> even after <unknown> rooms . For $ 400 a night after tax , I strongly <unknown> you to check for <unknown> . <stop>
<s> Excellent Hotel ! Rooms and service were great . A great value ! I have been to places that are not as good for nearly twice the price . Good location . Close to the L and short walk to rental car service . Restaurants in the area a bit of a disappointment , but the shopping was great . Area recommendations Great <unknown> , restaurants , museums and shopping . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the hotel during the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> tour and would come home each night rather <unknown> from being at an <unknown> concert with <unknown> of my <unknown> friends . I used half a bottle of shampoo the first night . The second night , the staff had not <unknown> my bar soap or shampoo . I informed the front desk who made <unknown> and said they would take care of it immediately . I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap ( hand soap ) for the <unknown> and they had replaced the shampoo in its <unknown> place , nicely <unknown> , but with the <unknown> <unknown> bottle of shampoo that was now <unknown> full . <unknown> ! ! The hotel is in a great location to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave ... .I 'll <unknown> them that ... .but that 's where their `` <unknown> '' end . I 'd rather stay at a <unknown> Inn . I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . <stop>
<s> Just returned from 2 nights at the Ambassador and I have to say that I am very happy that I chose this hotel . It is true that this is an older hotel . But it is well kept and it does not lack in style and <unknown> . ( think of the hotel from the <unknown> , <unknown> the elevator of blood and <unknown> <unknown> . ) From the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids , I was made to feel like <unknown> . A special <unknown> goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions . Also the location of the hotel is great . Close to all the <unknown> , but on a quite <unknown> street with beautiful old <unknown> . I also got a sweet $ <unknown> per night room by booking on <unknown> . That was just an added bonus however . Even if I paid $ 200 per night , my impression of the Ambassador would not change . Highly , highly recommended . <stop>
<s> I was in Chicago for a convention and stayed at the Sheraton towers . I had a negative experience because I got about one dozen very <unknown> bites by bed bugs on my <unknown> . It made attending the conference uncomfortable . The staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room , as the conference had booked the whole hotel . After the sheets were changed , I got no more bites , thankfully . Despite this , I managed to enjoy the stay . I liked the location next to the river , and the fact that it was easy to walk to Magnificent Mile . <stop>
<s> I gave the Conrad a second try at <unknown> me and it failed <unknown> . The hotel will not honor room requests . I <unknown> this was for a special <unknown> and would love a room with a view on my reservation . I got there and my <unknown> ' was of the adjacent office building windows . I did n't pay nearly $ 400 a night for that . I called down and the manager was absolutely rude . `` That would 've required you to pay at least $ 40 <unknown> '' Rude . Lots and lots of <unknown> happened . <unknown> pillows were never sent up , the <unknown> sound was not <unknown> ( <unknown> . NO sound ) , when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little . I 've had better service at a <unknown> Inn ! When they screwed up our breakfast <unknown> I had to physically go down and question <unknown> they said `` we will send them right up '' .. No , that never happened . Absolutely ridiculous . The bathroom has always been nice , and the room had been renovated since I was there last year ( thank the <unknown> ! ) ... It had a nice ambiance to it . The bed was quite nice as well . The valet guys were fantastic , probably the nicest men within that entire hotel . Also the bellman , and <unknown> were wonderfully sweet and always said `` <unknown> '' or `` hope you have a wonderful day '' .. I appreciated that . Perhaps the management <unknown> needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service . Breakfast at the Conrad restaurant is to be <unknown> completely . The service was <unknown> <unknown> , and not to mention slow . We had two different <unknown> and it took <unknown> of 15 minutes just to get our juice . They looked like they hated their <unknown> , and treated us with the same attitude . We were never checked on after the food came . The food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking . I got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin ( <unknown> ) , a small croissant , and a tiny <unknown> roll . 14 dollars for that . <unknown> . <unknown> if you choose , for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice ! <unknown> yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money . Overall , the managers need to learn what customer service means , and how to <unknown> over <unknown> for a customer . Otherwise your business will <unknown> . And the Conrad has <unknown> for me . I spent way too much money on terrible service . I 've already sent my <unknown> to Hilton <unknown> . I 'll be looking at other hotels the next time <unknown> in Chicago . <stop>
<s> This was a wonderful stay . The staff was extremely helpful , The rooms are especially large , and the fact they have a small kitchen makes everything a lot more easy . The breakfast and <unknown> were excellent . They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - for <unknown> , they have <unknown> <unknown> you can take up to your room . the business center , gym and pool also make this my first choice next time in Chicago . <stop>
<s> This was our second time staying here . We were very much looking forward to our weekend at the Amalfi ( based on how well the first stay was ) . It turned out better than our <unknown> . The beds are very comfortable . 2 headed showers with a large bathroom . The hotel is also pleasantly quiet and easy to check-in and out . Our room was near the exercise room which helped <unknown> us to get in an hour morning workout . Then we were able to <unknown> some complimentary fruit , pastries , juice and coffee on our floor ( breakfast is on every floor ) . No great view from our room , but I do n't think there are great views from most any room since it is only 5 floors . We did n't need to drive , take a cab or <unknown> on the L the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located . We easily walked to bars , <unknown> <unknown> , restaurants , the <unknown> tower , the loop and the <unknown> all from our hotel . The highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour . Free <unknown> drinks and wonderful <unknown> , cheeses , <unknown> , and breads . This ran from <unknown> to <unknown> , and was a great <unknown> to a nice dinner . This alone <unknown> us a <unknown> in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening . And an extra <unknown> tip ... park at the <unknown> lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on <unknown> . Its $ 24 per night during the week and only $ 6 per night on the weekends . I think the hotel charges $ 30 to $ 40 per night to park . <stop>
<s> My wife and I stayed here in the middle of February <unknown> . We took the ( <unknown> ) subway to the hotel from O'Hare . It was very convenient . The lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable . I 've stayed in many a hotel room , this bed was the most comfortable I 've ever slept in . The hotel is located in a great area and close to everything . <unknown> distance to almost all the interesting sites Chicago has . Would <unknown> recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city . <stop>
<s> This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years . The first room they gave us was a <unknown> . TINY and the bathroom was a <unknown> , , you had to <unknown> inside , move out of the way just to shut the door . The furniture is disgusting and all the <unknown> <unknown> was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times . so they <unknown> us to the <unknown> suite ' That room had a tiny <unknown> I mean TINY ! The furniture was <unknown> and dirty . It was on the 3rd level so you heard every <unknown> on the street below and traffic was loud . The only impressive part is the <unknown> but do n't be <unknown> . because after that .. the floors above look like they need a major <unknown> and the rooms were not worth even $ 100 per night . we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal . I do n't think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we do n't ever want to go back there again . 2 <unknown> at best for the <unknown> Knickerbocker . They should be <unknown> of themselves for even <unknown> guests to stay in those rooms . <unknown> . <unknown> , <unknown> <stop>
<s> I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years . On business , for personal trips . This trip started off quite <unknown> , and left me very <unknown> . 1 ) Be aware , they have a new policy where they charge debit card $ <unknown> per day for `` <unknown> '' which you <unknown> <unknown> . They do this if you <unknown> not to use a standard credit card . Even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance . The desk clerk claimed `` all the hotels do this now '' ... <unknown> how when I put a remote employee at the O'Hare hilton on my business debit card , I was never asked for additional <unknown> . Having a policy is one thing , <unknown> <unknown> for it is another . While not a problem for me , someone who <unknown> trips down to the dollar and <unknown> might <unknown> a problem with this `` policy '' of <unknown> . To my <unknown> , they never did this sort of thing before . ( I do n't use <unknown> <unknown> , its why I have money in a <unknown> . <unknown> ) ) 2 ) Rooms were clean , but their in room <unknown> and mini bar items had no price list . The only thing <unknown> with a price was a bottle of water ( about <unknown> <unknown> ) for $ <unknown> . As such , be <unknown> with the <unknown> of <unknown> . If the water is $ <unknown> , imagine what the <unknown> bar might cost . 3 ) Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken , and would not move . <unknown> the front desk <unknown> in ... nothing . Finally about <unknown> PM I <unknown> to have another look at it , and it seemed to be off its track . I was able to <unknown> `` fix '' it , but the lack of response from maintenance , considering the rate for a suite , is sad . I remember this hotel being much more attentive and <unknown> . 4 ) The seem to cut a lot of <unknown> on room <unknown> now . Overall , I think I will be <unknown> the Omni , and they will get no more of my business . It seems Hilton <unknown> people better overall . It 's quite sad , as I have a lot of good <unknown> with Omni . I will not be back . <stop>
<s> After reading all the <unknown> reviews for this hotel , I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to <unknown> off any <unknown> . I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels , particularly the Mark <unknown> in <unknown> . I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was <unknown> as Ambassador Club . When I arrived at the hotel , there was no separate check-in line ( as advertised ) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room . I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the <unknown> attitude of the manager on duty . They gave me a room in the `` modern '' tower , ( built in the 60 's ) which was about <unknown> the size of a regular room at the Mark <unknown> ( built in <unknown> ) . I had to deal with <unknown> sheets , cracked marble <unknown> , and the <unknown> roll of toilet paper being located <unknown> the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that ? The closet door , if you are not <unknown> , may break the full <unknown> mirror attached to the bathroom door . I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service , which never happened . The next day , they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and <unknown> to an upgraded room , but since I travel with a <unknown> device which I already set up in the tiny room , I <unknown> . To their credit , they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be <unknown> to as an Ambassador Club member . I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago . There are other better places for the money including , the Omni , The James , The Fairmont , Hyatt , Sheraton , Monaco , <unknown> <unknown> , even the Holiday Inn and <unknown> located in the same general area . <stop>
<s> From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel . It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty . Another person , perhaps the manager , was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line <unknown> . The hotels elevators are small <unknown> in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors , especially when 1 of the 3 <unknown> , as seems to be frequent <unknown> . After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators , I was assigned to a room directly across from them , <unknown> another 20 minute wait in line . The room smelled of mildew and water <unknown> from the ceiling the first night . I requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again . <unknown> , the hotel is <unknown> and poorly <unknown> . Never again ! <stop>
<s> We stayed at this hotel for a conference . The lobby and the conference areas were immaculate . The restaurants ( one of which was <unknown> 's <unknown> ) and bars were great . The <unknown> was <unknown> helpful . The rooms left a lot to be desired ... Our <unknown> room smelled of smoke . The <unknown> system was <unknown> and <unknown> , and the bathroom was old and in need of a <unknown> . It was surprising to see since the <unknown> <unknown> was so nice . We would choose , however , to stay elsewhere . <unknown> for the money we paid . <stop>
<s> THE <unknown> I booked a room here and was told I 'd be getting a king bed . When I check in , they say they only have a queen bed room available . I <unknown> to no <unknown> . When I got to the room , it was really only a full size bed . So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny <unknown> closet of a room in Chicago . For the pleasure , I paid the same price as a normal king bed room . The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable . I think it was <unknown> <unknown> because they never <unknown> the <unknown> . We would wake up with body <unknown> and <unknown> . My wife even said she lost feeling in her <unknown> some nights . Not good . Also , the internet in the room is hard to set-up , slow to use , and <unknown> . I generally had to <unknown> my computer at least once to get the internet to work . The internet worked one day on my <unknown> and then would not <unknown> me in . It 's not really worth it . <unknown> <unknown> Room service was very <unknown> and <unknown> . Some <unknown> they would take our towels ( even the ones we hung up to use again ) and not replace them , other times they would replace some towels and not others . They would also come at <unknown> different times . HOTEL <unknown> This hotel <unknown> to <unknown> and <unknown> . I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it 'd be $ 25 . No other hotel I 've ever stayed in ( <unknown> of how many <unknown> it had ) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room . <unknown> checkout ? charge . <unknown> from the airport ? - <unknown> . The front <unknown> `` <unknown> <unknown> '' people ca n't even figure out how to get you points . In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay ( not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again ) . By the way , apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing . I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $ 25 . THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower . The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses . The bars are extremely expensive , but the drinks are tasty . The food is <unknown> too , but I would n't <unknown> about it . The hotel is not directly on the main street ( Michigan ) , but it 's not too far from it . It 's right next to the boat <unknown> and , in some rooms , has a view of the Navy Pier . Our room <unknown> another hotel , but we could see a <unknown> of the <unknown> . The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park . It 's a bit of a walk to any of the L <unknown> though . If you want a wonderful breakfast place , go to <unknown> on <unknown> <unknown> . It 'll have you waiting to eat for a long time , but it 's yummy ! <unknown> I get better rooms , better beds , better service , and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best <unknown> . <unknown> the money and stay elsewhere . <stop>
<s> Swissotel was the <unknown> hotel I have ever stayed in ! The room and bathroom were quite large for downtown Chicago . The pool and hot tub were also very nice . I would definately recommend this hotel . We did n't hear any noise in our room from other guests or from the city . It is in a great location - walking distance to Millenium Park , the Loop and Michigan Ave . <stop>
<s> We were greeted by staff with excellent customer service <unknown> . Our room was such a pleasant surprise , from the flat screen TV , the full size shower with rain showerhead & hand held shower <unknown> , the wall attached toilet with <unknown> options ( on the wall ) , the comfortable bed , the lovely lighting options , <unknown> The size of the room was <unknown> , and very comfortable , as would be , in a historic hotel . It was also quiet , and I know that the hotel was sold out . My sister was in the room next door . We did not hear her TV . We also loved walking less than a block , to the shopping and restaurants on North Michigan Avenue . <stop>
<s> After reading some of the most recent reviews I 'm really <unknown> . I did n't know what to expect , but I was most pleasantly surprised . Just as all the past reviews , both negative and positive , have stated , you ca n't beat the location of this hotel . It 's perfect . We had a big spacious room in the old tower . We <unknown> the expensive <unknown> of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge . The beds were great , the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly . Great <unknown> in the hotel bar . I really ca n't understand the negative reviews . I know you ca n't please everyone , but in some cases I simply do n't believe their <unknown> . I 've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels . This is a great hotel ! <stop>
<s> This hotel was <unknown> for our girls getaway . The decor is fun & <unknown> . Loved the roof top bar . Every staff member was friendly & always smiling . The location is perfect for Michigan Ave shopping , the beach , dinner and night life . It was a mile or two from Millenium <unknown> . The concierge recommended a couple places to hang out after dinner and added our <unknown> to the guest list ( I 'm sure they do it all the time but still a nice <unknown> ) . <stop>
<s> After reading good reviews about I booked a 5 night stay . Checked in late bit called early in the day to <unknown> we 'd have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 <unknown> . They somehow had us booked for two rooms instead . Got that <unknown> out and arrived around 10 pm . Checked in and waited for our luggage ... Finally went down and got it ourselves . The room was a little <unknown> , furniture shabby , and discovered a <unknown> stain on the duvet cover . <unknown> . Called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and <unknown> handed to me . <unknown> it 's kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel . Next day tried to iron a <unknown> for dinner and the iron did n't work . Called for a <unknown> , waited a while , called again and was brought another iron which also did n't work . <unknown> time was a charm . Oh <unknown> . Too bad we paid in advance . <unknown> n't be staying here again . <stop>
<s> Stayed in April for two nights . I <unknown> <unknown> the Sheraton <unknown> I had a very poor stay there earlier this year . As far as I 'm concerned , that 's two <unknown> and I wo n't give them a chance at # three . <unknown> would n't help on arrival , huge line at <unknown> , <unknown> room , <unknown> remote , unresponsive staff , and incorrect bill . If you want to be close to Michigan Ave , try the Westin or Intercontinental and <unknown> yourself the problems . I do n't understand why certain places never improve . <unknown> it that tough to properly train a staff ? <stop>
<s> I recently stayed at the Sheraton for an <unknown> conference , and had problems from the <unknown> . I had problems with the check-in even though I had made <unknown> <unknown> to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file . The front desk <unknown> were kind of rude . The room was okay , not worth what I paid for . The sheets were kind of <unknown> up and the room did n't feel very clean . They also charge for internet access , which is ridiculous . Most hotels provide free wi-fi . The conference food , which I <unknown> is <unknown> by the hotel , was not good at all . On the day of the check out , I had arranged for a late check-out , but in the morning before check-out time , someone else got assigned to my room and was <unknown> to get in ! Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time . All in all , I would recommend staying somewhere else . <stop>
<s> Rude , rude , rude ! We stayed here on July 4th weekend . We drove from Michigan , we called customer service to get directions from <unknown> <unknown> is a major <unknown> to Chicago -- calling them from a <unknown> , telling them we 're in a middle of a <unknown> and that we 're lost ... <unknown> were put on hold , <unknown> to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again . <unknown> up we decided to just <unknown> the <unknown> and try our luck at a 7-11 store . When we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves . <unknown> in we were not greeted by anyone , even the receptionist did not <unknown> us ! ! no welcome to the <unknown> , nothing ! The man at the reception was rude , which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has . The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are <unknown> at 2 am ! ! Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier . The room is not even <unknown> , very small , probably a little bigger than a <unknown> closet . Stay here at your own <unknown> . <stop>
<s> Very <unknown> and romantic , yet <unknown> . I 've noticed that at most Chicago hotel bars it 's hard to get a drink much less a seat but I guess because it 's a small hotel that was not a problem at the Talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it 's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that ! Would love to stay again but I must say that I was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too <unknown> . Also note there is no gym on the <unknown> - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout ! <stop>
<s> Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Talbott . This was our first visit there , and I can honestly say that I would n't stay at any other hotel in Chicago . From when we first were <unknown> by the bell <unknown> until our final departure , the staff was nothing less than amazing , always greeting with a smile and can I help you <unknown> . The room we had ( <unknown> ) was very spacious and comfortable . The bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and I have ever slept in ( including the Four Seasons ) . Had great breakfasts and drinks at <unknown> 's . You would be missing a fantastic experience , if you did n't stay at the Talbott . <stop>
<s> I 'm a frequent business traveler and often in Chicago on trips . At times , it 's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown Chicago , and this was one of those times . I recently had to pay almost $ 400 for one night at the Allegro . It was absolutely not worth it . The hotel was filled to capacity with <unknown> , so check-in and check-out were very slow . There were very few elevators , which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests . The morning I checked out , our elevator stopped at every single floor from the <unknown> floor down to the lobby , but the elevator was almost completely full when I got on at the <unknown> floor , so I can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs . The room was extremely small and cramped , even though it had obviously been renovated recently . The TV , bed , and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel . <unknown> , the rate was way overpriced for such a small room . The best thing about the Allegro was the room service , which was prompt . The food was good , and the prices were very reasonable for room service . From now on , if my regular hotels are booked , I 'll just take a cab <unknown> out from the city because it just is n't worth it . <stop>
<s> I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed . The previous weekend , I stayed at a <unknown> star hotel a few blocks away , and was much more impressed there . The Hard Rock had a number of issues including : very dark room - not much light ( <unknown> or natural ) ; lots of street noise ; very cheap decor and furniture ; broken cabinet door ; very warm room - said they would send maintenance , but they never arrived ; had bar charges on account that were not ours . Overall , I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel . I expected a much better experience ! <stop>
<s> My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Conrad Chicago for our anniversary . The second we walked in , we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room . <unknown> <unknown> bedding on the King bed , plasma <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> sound <unknown> ( my boyfriend was more impressed than me , as I reminded him that we did n't come to Chicago for the hotel room ) very large bathroom w/ tub and separate <unknown> shower , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> her robes and slippers . The view was n't great , but we were on the 6th floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us . Not a large room by any means , but again . . . we did n't go to the city for the hotel room . It was the <unknown> size for the amount of time we were actually in the room . We got a great rate on it ( $ <unknown> at <unknown> ) but I think the going rate is usually closer to <unknown> $ 200 's . I 've stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one . We will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city . <stop>
<s> I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels , however I have never experienced top service as I did at the Hotel Allegro . Even before my visit , concierge Mark <unknown> <unknown> us on things to see , and booked tickets in advance to Second City . We were welcomed warmly on arrival , and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel . All the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience . The hotel is next to City Hall , where I had some business . We had a large quiet room , and used room <unknown> meal came quickly , and included a a bonus fruit cup . <unknown> the pasta night ( 20 dollars for a three course meal ) at the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> and the dessert were wonderful , the main pasta a bit too <unknown> . And that is the only complaint I can <unknown> start to finish , if you want attentive service , this is the place to be . Thank you , Hotel Allegro , for a great stay . I ca n't wait to return . <stop>
<s> We just returned from a girls shopping <unknown> <unknown> Palmer House was like home away from <unknown> hotel is undergoing renovations but we did not notice any <unknown> or hear any noise from the <unknown> lobby was breathtaking , all <unknown> up for <unknown> staff from check-in to housekeeping was very welcoming and <unknown> room was updated with two beds and two separate baths which was great for everyone to have their own personal <unknown> would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to <unknown> is a great town . <stop>
<s> this is my letter to the management ... .. <unknown> or <unknown> : I am <unknown> to give <unknown> about our recent stay the Amalfi . We were a guest from <unknown> to <unknown> . During our stay we used the `` Valet '' Service <unknown> through <unknown> Parking . Our <unknown> was returned with <unknown> items from the <unknown> <unknown> . Much to my <unknown> , $ <unknown> valet service did not <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , despite the premium over `` <unknown> park '' . I understand that these parking services are <unknown> by the hotel , but I would think that any <unknown> hotel would <unknown> the situation . This was not the case . I hope that your staff will be able to take <unknown> to rectify the situation for future guests <stop>
<s> This is best hotel <unknown> in Chicago if you are not <unknown> unhappy with a small room . Great hotel just <unknown> by Kimpton . This is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of <unknown> and fun to all of their hotels . This is a location just off of <unknown> and next to the <unknown> theater . It has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a <unknown> atmosphere an amazing Italian meal . The wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants . The Kimptons have a <unknown> hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels . You sit in a <unknown> , kind of London <unknown> <unknown> couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of <unknown> with you <unknown> guests . They are super <unknown> friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it . The exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well . There are two other Kimptons here but for the money the Allegro is the best value and location . Always consider Kimptons as they never <unknown> where ever we have used them . <stop>
<s> The service from check-in to checkout was excellent - <unknown> and efficient . The room was more then I has expected . It was spacious and laid out very well . I particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower . The bed <unknown> pillows were extremely comfortable . I believe it 's the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a <unknown> and <unknown> in the room . The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go . I particularly enjoyed the excellent food at <unknown> <unknown> which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel . The service was very good and the staff very friendly . <stop>
<s> This is about the <unknown> time we stayed at the Allegro . The previous times , I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro . But my <unknown> has <unknown> on this place . We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the <unknown> <unknown> and our shopping . From the very start , this year was a disappointment . I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro . I was <unknown> one price ( higher than what was on line ) , when I mentioned this , I was told I could have the lower price . At check in , the desk was nice but not friendly . We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past ( <unknown> for asking for a lower price ? ) The closet had no hangers , we had no place to put our suitcase . No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening . On the second day , we discovered that even our bath <unknown> for the shower was missing . It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one . I wrote the management following our stay . I have yet to receive a <unknown> . <unknown> to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time . I would <unknown> others to do the same . <stop>
<s> My wife and I spent several nights here on a getaway <unknown> . I did n't choose it -- Priceline gave it to me for $ 70 . If I 'd paid the book rate , $ <unknown> , I 'd have been less pleased . No <unknown> with checkin . Very small room but bed was clean and comfortable . Starbucks in the lobby was a <unknown> . I 'd read <unknown> <unknown> about the staff but they seemed friendly enough . For $ 70 , it 's a steal . For its online face value , not so much . Will definitely return if can get similar price . <stop>
<s> I made reservations with the Chicago <unknown> using their 800 number for two nights in June . I received no written confirmation with <unknown> policy , etc . However , when I attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first night 's reservation , I was told that they would charge me for one nights stay . They have a `` 3pm THE <unknown> <unknown> your first nights stay '' policy . Even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not <unknown> on the policy . This is not a common policy on Michigan Ave . I 'd <unknown> making your reservations someplace that offers more <unknown> for <unknown> or <unknown> a written confirmation with policy . It was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel ! <stop>
<s> I stayed at the hotel one night . The hotel is excellent , comparable quality than Marriott and Sheraton , perhaps superior , but the location is definitely much better . <unknown> your trip <unknown> is , business or leisure , you can <unknown> your bags and take a walk on the Magnificent mile . Loved it ! <stop>
<s> This was my first time in Chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location . This definitely fit the bill . I could walk to all the places I wanted to see - very close to Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile . <unknown> a 15 minute walk to the Art Institute . The hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful . There was coffee in the lobby every morning , that was very welcome . The room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet . I could hear the train and some traffic from the street ( considering the location , this was n't bad and did n't <unknown> my ability to sleep or <unknown> ) . I would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem ! ! <stop>
<s> First room 's heating system sounded like we had a <unknown> in our room . Second room had <unknown> in the toilet and a <unknown> on the linens ( which we did n't notice until <unknown> ! ) . The computer , <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> did n't work . The <unknown> man took 30 mins to come <unknown> the toilet and <unknown> to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet . This room was quiet and the <unknown> comfortable . The bath was large and water warm . <stop>
<s> The Palmer House has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant . The rooms are way too small ! ! ! Two people in a room with a King size bed can barely move around . Not enough room for two <unknown> . Our room was very <unknown> us of the movie The <unknown> . VERY <unknown> ! ! ! ! Do n't expect a quiet stay . You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is <unknown> in the hallways . We requested a room change as soon as we checked in . The room that we <unknown> were in had a huge <unknown> cut out of the wall that had exposed <unknown> , <unknown> , dirt and dust . Oh and the construction for their renovations <unknown> at 7 <unknown> during the week . We will never stay at the Palmer House again . You are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel . <stop>
<s> As a frequent traveler for work , I stay at many <unknown> properties . <unknown> to all the <unknown> property in Chicago , this is by far the worst . Why ? 1 ) They charge you to use the gym . $ 12 per day or something like $ 24 for your entire stay . I ca n't even begin on what a rip off that is . 2 ) As a Gold or <unknown> member , you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room . They do not offer that option here and you have to make a <unknown> about it before they give you one . 3 ) They do not have wireless internet . It is <unknown> enough said . To charge you at least over $ 200 a night , all the above amenities should be built into that cost . I would never stay here again . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the James hotel for a <unknown> birthday . The location was excellent for shopping and restaurants , but also very loud . The room was horrible . VERY <unknown> . We had a <unknown> and it was the size of a college <unknown> room , plus completely white walls and linens . Absolutely no <unknown> except for one <unknown> pillow . It was very <unknown> and uninviting . We were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and <unknown> with <unknown> lighting . It looked like the entrance to hell , if not a <unknown> house . Staff was very nice and accomodating . I would not return to this hotel . <stop>
<s> My husband , teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last August . We were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of Chicago . When I complained I asked for us to be transferred to the Sheraton which they arranged for us . I have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best . The room ( although I know it was not the largest ) was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed . It also had superb views of the river and the lake . The entrance hall to the Sheraton is so <unknown> as is the leisure centre . In fact all areas are fantastic . The best thing about the hotel though was the staff ! From the <unknown> , to the <unknown> , the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful . One of the <unknown> spent <unknown> minutes on the phone trying to <unknown> a <unknown> pair of <unknown> for my son ! <unknown> and beyond the call I would say ! I can not <unknown> this hotel highly enough . The breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did ! ! It <unknown> us all day . If you have the choice of where to stay I think you will enjoy the Sheraton ! We did ! ! <stop>
<s> Stayed for 2 nights at The James , wonderful location 2 mins walk to Michigan Avenue with all the shops . Staff here were all incredibly helpful and <unknown> friendly . Nothing was too much trouble . Rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable I have slept in . Room was very clean , had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a <unknown> flat screen tv . There was a bar area with <unknown> , mini bar and coffee maker . There was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area . Bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo , conditioner , shower <unknown> and body lotion . Hotel is also `` pet friendly '' . There was even a large bowl of <unknown> water and a <unknown> of dog <unknown> at the front door of the hotel ! ! ! . <unknown> even had their own options on the room <unknown> menu . <stop>
<s> Stayed at the Monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic . Very convenient for walking to museums , shopping and park nearby . The room has a great <unknown> window that you can sit in and enjoy the view . We also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and <unknown> of the hotel . <unknown> staff , wifi , Aveda products , decent restaurant downstairs for brunch , easy to get a taxi and nothing <unknown> the location . I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel , for business or pleasure . <stop>
<s> My family and I have just had a two week <unknown> in Chicago , and we stayed for a week at the Hilton Towers . We had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel . The <unknown> size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and <unknown> . If you prefer <unknown> modern <unknown> hotels , maybe this would n't be your thing . However if you enjoy old style <unknown> and <unknown> , you will be <unknown> over by this hotel . The place literally <unknown> thanks to the enormous <unknown> that are everywhere in the lobby . <unknown> of <unknown> have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is <unknown> . We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place ! <stop>
<s> We stayed two nights . We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant . He was very cold . Our room was very , very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days . The room was <unknown> decorated but <unknown> the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet . We were <unknown> to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink , the door to the bar was locked . We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really was n't and were told they were short <unknown> , <unknown> ' . <unknown> ? ? are you running here ? You are a hotel in the <unknown> 's third largest city and your amenities are open at <unknown> ? This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel . <stop>
<s> The <unknown> has a noisy <unknown> in each room . It <unknown> every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up . At least the first night . This is an old <unknown> system that needs to be replaced . The <unknown> service at the hotel is <unknown> . The hotel <unknown> up our concert tickets that was correctly <unknown> and <unknown> by <unknown> . The tickets were at the Hotel <unknown> <unknown> office . The reception <unknown> that they had arrived . We had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it . The Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience . The concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago . <unknown> , the Hotel had good standard , free internet in the lobby , not to good view from the rooms , and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars . We had booked 20 <unknown> all <unknown> staying at room <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> from the 23rd June . <stop>
<s> I have stayed at the James a few times , it is my go to hotel in Chicago . This last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options . The Good : Location is awesome , just off Michigan Ave , <unknown> <unknown> 's across street for some <unknown> <unknown> . It is a great location , easy to walk most anywhere . The door staff are very friendly and helpful . The overall feeling is modern , <unknown> . <unknown> down service with cookie is nice . Free <unknown> ( which worked to <unknown> degrees throughout stay ) The Bad : They claim to be a 4.5 star hotel , which to me , means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star ( without a pool ) . They used to have <unknown> toiletries and now have `` <unknown> '' brand . <unknown> , they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you . It is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym , but not a 4.5 star hotel . I asked about the switch ( <unknown> because when I booked they still had <unknown> in website <unknown> ) and they claimed that the reason they went the <unknown> bottle route was to be `` <unknown> '' . That is hard to believe , as it 's not like the hotel is making other <unknown> to be <unknown> ( they still have <unknown> light <unknown> , housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down , they do n't <unknown> in room , etc ) . They are obviously trying to cut costs , and it shows . <unknown> : the rooms are in need of some updating , they are looking somewhat tired . My third floor room was quite loud with the <unknown> trying to <unknown> their <unknown> out front ( not their fault ) . Do n't take the stairs ( as the <unknown> is <unknown> out of <unknown> movie ) , even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be <unknown> . The phone staff was fairly rude ( granted , they did n't like me <unknown> their <unknown> change ) . I feel bad giving such a low rating , but it really did not come close to my expectations ( from previous stays there ) . I will start trying out new hotels in the area . <stop>
<s> Got a good deal on a weekend <unknown> in this Hotel and have to say it is the nicest stay I have had in more than a dozen business trips to Chicago . All rooms are Suites , staff is friendly and professional , Restaurant is out of this world and all the extras like a great health club , turn down service , complimentary morning beverages delivered to room and on and on . Room was very clean and every need was attended to without feeling <unknown> on . Will definately stay here again . <stop>
<s> Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco . We have stayed many times elsewhere , <unknown> in <unknown> DC and are <unknown> to great customer service , beverages like water or soda at the wine bar , coffee and <unknown> in the morning , help with bags . Not only did the Chicago <unknown> do none of these things , the staff was not helpful , either . <unknown> were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there . <unknown> got the feeling you were `` <unknown> '' people if you asked a question . No bellman , the doorman did not open the door or help with bags . Even though we were traveling with a child , I had to request a fish when they did not bring it . Really <unknown> as we love the Monoco in Washington . <stop>
<s> A very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms . The decor was lovely . My daughter and I spent <unknown> here , saw <unknown> just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town . Was a bit disappointed with the <unknown> which opened and closed it 's kitchen at will without <unknown> to posted hours . The room <unknown> <unknown> of safe 's large enough to <unknown> a <unknown> , so I brought <unknown> . I was informed after check-in that the <unknown> are not in every room ( and not in <unknown> ) . As a side note , I was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area ... even the 7-11 . <stop>
<s> My family has <unknown> the Omni in Chicago `` <unknown> Towers '' because there always seems to be something wrong . This time our room was right above the kitchen and the <unknown> of cooking <unknown> <unknown> through our bedroom all night long . It smelled like a <unknown> <unknown> restaurant and it <unknown> all of our <unknown> . The bedroom window was <unknown> shut , so we could n't get any fresh air into the room . With the amount that the Omni is charging for a room , they should have a much better <unknown> system . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Hilton Chicago because I was attending a conference at the hotel . The room was <unknown> - had a coffee maker , bed , hangers , tv , etc . That 's about where my <unknown> end : <unknown> rates are <unknown> . $ <unknown> for a breakfast buffet ? $ 25 to use the gym ? $ <unknown> for WiFi ! ? ! ? ! This is unacceptable when I 'm paying $ <unknown> per night . Thank <unknown> the ice was free . <unknown> in the restaurant and bar were <unknown> , not <unknown> in <unknown> , and just rude . <unknown> <unknown> in rooms are <unknown> and turn on at <unknown> times during the night <unknown> was incredibly cold ... <unknown> was wearing their <unknown> the entire time , despite our complaints to management . <unknown> in room was not <unknown> . had to store cold items in the ice <unknown> . <unknown> channels just flat out <unknown> . I was soooo <unknown> when I had to spend an hour in my room . If I 'm paying that much , at least provide the full 70 channels . <stop>
<s> This hotel had a great location , but you can do much better for the money . The hallways smelled of smoke , dirty elevators , furniture in the lobby was <unknown> bare . The staff was very helpful . The room was large , bed comfortable but the room was so <unknown> and old smoke <unknown> . If you have any <unknown> do n't stay here ! <stop>
<s> We just returned from 4 nights at the Ambassador East . What a gem ! The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the Magnificent Mile . There is a train station about 2 blocks away . The room was very comfortable , with nice amenities , and there is free Internet service on the 2nd floor . Best of all was the bell and lobby staff ! They really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived . I would say that this was the nicest hotel staff I 've encountered in all my travels . <stop>
<s> I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online . Unfortunately , it was a very disappointing experience . When we arrived , we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was <unknown> . So , we had to move to another hotel . Amalfi did take care of the other hotel , cab fare , and after much <unknown> ... breakfast . We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very <unknown> . Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the <unknown> as we had planned , we had to get up , pack up our <unknown> , check out of the hotel , take a cab , check back into the Amalfi , only then could we head to the <unknown> . We were also told that our first night 's stay would be <unknown> . Well , more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later ... there still has n't been a refund . I ca n't even get a manager to call me back . The Amalfi was n't all bad , it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance . The <unknown> reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers . However , it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended . One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of <unknown> , but they seemed really small for queens . Our view from our room was of the alley . So , overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the <unknown> floor . Very disappointing indeed ! <stop>
<s> Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice , but the <unknown> and attitude of the staff is beyond <unknown> . First , a member of the staff <unknown> our room <unknown> <unknown> only to apologize after <unknown> that he failed to <unknown> that we were present . Not a tremendous problem , but when the young woman at the front desk <unknown> `` What do you want me to do about it '' with the tone of a <unknown> teenager , I began to suspect that a <unknown> <unknown> in <unknown> may have been <unknown> in the staff . <unknown> forward to this evening . <unknown> a lovely meal off the <unknown> , we chose to turn in a bit early at <unknown> pm only to discover that despite our best <unknown> , the <unknown> from a party downstairs was more than <unknown> in our room . <unknown> <unknown> and with <unknown> , we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been <unknown> <unknown> into the party downstairs , but yet again we were met with a <unknown> and quite rude response . <unknown> at the front desk informed us that the party was a <unknown> <unknown> for the hotel , and that the family <unknown> that the music was to be set at a certain <unknown> . On one hand I appreciated his <unknown> , but on the other , I truly would have preferred that he at least <unknown> to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property . Since we 're out of options for the evening , we 've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being , but given the <unknown> , the staff could have easily made up for the negative <unknown> that <unknown> in quick <unknown> . Also , I was <unknown> to learn that while I slept the prior night , a possible <unknown> <unknown> took place <unknown> blocks from the property . This would n't have been a concern if like nearby hotels , the Knickerbocker chose to <unknown> any type of security <unknown> within their lobby . Would I stay here again ? Maybe on a <unknown> , or if someone else was <unknown> the bill . <unknown> I 've had better experiences in road side motels , and the employee training <unknown> could use a <unknown> <unknown> to better serve the <unknown> of the guests , and more importantly simple common sense . <stop>
<s> While it was a nice hotel , but i am rather frustrated with them ! During our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping . The first day was fine . Second day my diamond <unknown> came up missing . <unknown> they were missing while in the <unknown> up and checking out process . My biggest mistake was not staying there and <unknown> with this <unknown> . But we had a family <unknown> and <unknown> to get to . While the front desk was great and said they would handle it , I believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way ! We <unknown> a <unknown> report and the GM of the hotel is supposed to be working on it . We have called several times but receive no <unknown> . They keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 + years ... <unknown> <unknown> n't matter to me ! If they are not held <unknown> what 's to stop them from taking anything . There is a dishwasher in the room , and they found my daughters <unknown> ( which was in the same glass with my diamond <unknown> ) in the dishwasher . They say I put the cup in the dishwasher . First , I am on vacation , <unknown> me i 'm NOT doing <unknown> ! Second , why would I wash one glass and leave the other dirty <unknown> in the room ? So , while it is a nice hotel ... <unknown> up your things of value ! They may come up `` missing '' and you 'll be left frustrated ! ! <stop>
<s> Ok , I just feel if you 're paying well over $ 200 for a room you should get something to show for it . The location was on Michigan Ave but if I pay just a little more I could have had way better ( Peninsula , Park Hyatt , <unknown> the Omni was <unknown> better ) . We ordered a deluxe executive suite , and it was so below <unknown> <unknown> . The room was very small ( so small the ice <unknown> was in the closet ) , the bathroom was just as small , just well <unknown> ( a plus ) . <unknown> was peeling , outlets barely covered , no view . The only thing <unknown> was the bed , and that may have been because I was so tired . And we were really excited because this is the Palmer House . The Palmer House does have nice restaurants : the Lockwood ( quiet , <unknown> ) and the <unknown> 's Lounge ( <unknown> ) <stop>
<s> I was very disappointed with the hotel this time . They seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit . The clientele also seem to be of a lower quality . The lobby was quite a <unknown> scene with no one on staff <unknown> to notice . The house <unknown> only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee ; she also left the dirty coffee <unknown> in the room . I think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time . <stop>
<s> Very centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day <unknown> <unknown> ( my room looked down upon Wacker <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> and the Chicago River . Small room , virtually no storage space . <unknown> a conference with the Monaco as <unknown> . They provided adequate service , with no problems . This was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their <unknown> Stay program . I never felt comfortable in this hotel . I 'm 60 <unknown> old and it <unknown> the clientele they <unknown> is half my age . Rude front <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> . The young people can have at it . I 'll stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time . <stop>
<s> I stayed here for about a week during a conference and the service was excellent . In addition to the excellent service the location was great . With quick access to Michigan <unknown> The bars and <unknown> 's restaurant were excellent . You must have the <unknown> <unknown> ... very well done . <stop>
<s> When I called to <unknown> my <unknown> reservation , I was placed on hold for 30 minutes ! Finally someone came on the phone and said , `` <unknown> have to <unknown> you '' , so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes . When I finally did get to speak to someone , as I was going through my changes , I asked her to send me a <unknown> copy of the reservation to which she <unknown> and <unknown> very put off . Before she was able to <unknown> with me , I said `` I have one more question '' to which she <unknown> `` I 'm working at the front desk and I have customers waiting ! '' I thought , so am I not your customer ? <unknown> and rude . Hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay . <stop>
<s> The <unknown> was a wonderful hotel ! When me and my mom <unknown> in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap . We didnt want to get up ! The beds are absolutely to <unknown> for . I wanted to take it home with me . The service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel <unknown> ever stayed in . They had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food . <stop>
<s> We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August . We waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few <unknown> open , this was a little annoying as the <unknown> seemed to work in two 's . Our room had a great view of Navy Pier and was a good size . The bed was very comfortable and the room was <unknown> clean . The location of the hotel is the best , we walked to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . The breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a <unknown> or two . Would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again . <stop>
<s> We absolutely loved the Knickerbocker . Now , if you expect your hotels to be cookie <unknown> comfortable , <unknown> this place . If Holiday <unknown> are like the <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> , the Knickerbocker is like those beautiful old <unknown> in the center of the city . The location is great , the hotel bar is cozy and classy , and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in <unknown> <unknown> . For the price , you simply ca n't do any better than this in downtown Chicago . <stop>
<s> Will start by saying the employees were wonderful , especially in the restaurant / bar employees , could not have been nicer ... <unknown> appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyond ... <unknown> , that 's where it <unknown> ! The rooms , in my opinion , appeared different then pictures and were worn and <unknown> ... you know , uninviting sofa and <unknown> coffee table and desk area ... the first room I was given had bright construction lights <unknown> in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my window ! ! I <unknown> you not ; they seemed as if they were about 15-20 <unknown> from my window ! ! And this was after I specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent <unknown> was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly , again ... just worn out ! ! ! NOT a 4 star hotel , this seemed to be closer to a 2 , perhaps being extremely kind 3 star ... I travel on business so I know the difference ... I merely <unknown> the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand ! I complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit , she made sure the door was fixed <unknown> . They gave me a bottle of wine to <unknown> I <unknown> to <unknown> my <unknown> as to my <unknown> for the next 2 days ... .I wanted to give Omni a <unknown> ... big mistake ... Unfortunately , brought a friend with me to show her how great Chicago was and I was soooo <unknown> , as I had chosen the hotel ... She was extremely disappointed as well ... should have gone with my first <unknown> which was the Conrad ! ! <unknown> learned ! <stop>
<s> This hotel was chosen for me for a business convention . The lobby was pretty cool . But the rooms were tiny and very dark . I had a huge picture of <unknown> above my toilet . It was very hard to do my <unknown> or read because of the lighting . The location is <unknown> You have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of Michigan Ave , but its not too bad . Be prepared for some sad sights after dark . Apparently <unknown> is <unknown> in Chicago ( some <unknown> will give you a ticket for <unknown> ) because at night , the <unknown> come out . The <unknown> thing i saw was an older woman with her two <unknown> sitting on a <unknown> in the <unknown> <unknown> on a <unknown> temp night . <unknown> kids looked terrible . <unknown> its all up and down the <unknown> part of the city . You do n't see so many in the <unknown> . Also the room service at the Hard Rock is pretty good . Its plenty for 2 people . I would not stay here again though . I <unknown> the Omni Hotel . <stop>
<s> <unknown> the <unknown> of a nice building , friendly staff , and a <unknown> set of items in the minibar , this is somewhat <unknown> hotel . In particular , the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable I ever encountered . After two nights , my wife and I were <unknown> <unknown> by bed <unknown> . We complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room , but the other room was furnished <unknown> . The <unknown> of the Omni need to stop spending money on bath <unknown> for the rooms and <unknown> in the basic <unknown> . I should not be lying on the floor , trying to <unknown> my back , thinking <unknown> of the last Red Roof Inn I visited . <stop>
<s> This hotel was magnificent ! Not only was it a mini <unknown> , but the staff was polite , helpful , and professional . In an e-mail I received before we left for Chicago , the concierge , <unknown> , offered to get us tickets , directions , reservations to anything we 'd like to <unknown> . He also got us an upgrade on our room , and when someone rudely <unknown> in line as we were <unknown> , the <unknown> person said they would upgrade our room just for that . And so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and <unknown> . The bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning ! <stop>
<s> We 've stayed here before but this time around was a <unknown> difference in quality and service - the staff was n't rude , just incompetent . For <unknown> , we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room , which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel . <unknown> , the staff brought us 4 coffee <unknown> ... The list of issues goes on unfortunately , including the low grade in-room movie options - our <unknown> and video did not <unknown> on our rental ; we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes . And the room itself was not clean ; the bathroom sink vent <unknown> were <unknown> with mold . <unknown> the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities , but training or <unknown> staff ... oh , but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same . <unknown> a newer hotel , there are many in this great city . <stop>
<s> Spent a wonderful night at the Amalfi with friends . The evening reception was very nice and the staff was very attentive . Breakfast was a plus , rooms were cozy and very clean . Would not hesitate to go back again . <stop>
<s> Well , this used to be a <unknown> <unknown> Hotel , and it has changed for the worse . We kept having to <unknown> them we booked a package , because we were being <unknown> <unknown> for everything , when it should have been included . We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival , and did not . Two phone calls and three hours later , it finally showed up . We tried to have a drink in the bar , and even though we were the ONLY people there , three <unknown> came and went , talking to each other , not one of them <unknown> us . After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink . And do n't bother to pay extra for `` City <unknown> '' ; because you may get the view we had from only the <unknown> floor , looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see . Oh yes , the valet lost his cell phone in someone 's car , and called me at home today to see if we found it . He wanted me to call him back at home . Nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff , <unknown> ? For the money , stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same <unknown> and it will be much much better . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Ritz Carlton two weeks prior , and in comparison the Sofitel does not come close . With the deal the Ritz Carlton is putting on right now , stay two nights ... get one free , choose the nicer option ! Pros : Room Service : <unknown> ! 15 minutes <unknown> . Bathroom : Large bathroom with a separate shower and tub . Lobby : Very impressive , and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and <unknown> a cab for you . Location : Close to the train station and <unknown> Ave. Cons : NO <unknown> <unknown> ! We asked the others at the conference , they confirmed ... there is no top <unknown> . You just sleep with the duvet cover over you . Room : <unknown> , and not a fan of the modern decor . <unknown> closet door , the bottom track was bent . By the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so I could get to my things . <unknown> any storage : closet was <unknown> tiny <unknown> , almost no bigger than a <unknown> locker , only the top drawers of the <unknown> open . <unknown> : <unknown> water pressure . -The cleaning staff did not replace shampoo , soap , etc . Had to call the front desk , and they delivered within 10 mins . -The cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there , realized this as I still noticed a stain we made the first night . I made sure not to leave the `` save the water '' card out . They changed our towels , but not the bedding ? ? ? <unknown> room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff <unknown> , and you could heard that door <unknown> shut all hours of the day . <unknown> charge for Wi-Fi ! <unknown> can change the <unknown> on the tv ... <unknown> , etc . <stop>
<s> If you 're in Chicago and want to stay in The Loop , The Allegro Hotel is perfect for you . It 's centrally located , stylish rooms and attentive staff . I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was very pleased with everything . The bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows , large flat screen tv , radio with <unknown> <unknown> station and bathroom was hip and clean . Everyone that I came in contact with was very friendly and helpful . My last day there , I ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time , the kitchen called to see if everything was alright . I have never had that kind of follow up service . I 've stayed at the <unknown> in DC , another Kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too . I will definitely see if Kimpton has a hotel at my next <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I was <unknown> to stay at the Hard Rock in June , but had to cancel . I had booked the hotel back in January . When I called <unknown> days before my arrival date to cancel , I was told that I would be charged for my stay because I did not cancel seven days in advance . I told the customer service <unknown> that I had never heard of such a practice , but she said , in a very <unknown> <unknown> , that I was told back in January . I honestly do n't remember being told of the cancellation policy , but think it is a unprofessional practice to <unknown> some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to <unknown> a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel . I , for one , will never stay at a Hard Rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business <unknown> know of this <unknown> practice . <stop>
<s> First let me say , I try not to be too <unknown> , but in some cases the truth is <unknown> ! We checked in and things seemed fine . Location was excellent . <unknown> up the first morning , to a slightly <unknown> bed covered in `` stains '' , I <unknown> and not 4 star hotel quality . <unknown> a <unknown> change and heard a <unknown> on the <unknown> a <unknown> was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the <unknown> sign , I did and no one even came until later in the day . The room was big enough , had no drawers , <unknown> remodeled but carpet did n't reach the wall , toilet paper <unknown> fell off constantly and shower head was broken . The <unknown> were great and the water was always hot ! The walls were paper thin , I heard every <unknown> the guests next door had . They were not noisy but you could hear everything including the <unknown> . through the walls and <unknown> . Internet was $ <unknown> , worked for a bit and then not again , I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on <unknown> the system and call back later . The hotel did give us a credit for the charges . At this point , enough was enough , we packed our bags and checked out . The front desk was very <unknown> <unknown> to <unknown> for <unknown> and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell <unknown> ! ! <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Swissotel for a three day weekend , and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived . <unknown> it just me , or is this information not clearly stated on their website ? A giant <unknown> where a lobby should have been was pretty <unknown> and <unknown> . The room itself was fine . <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> than the `` European <unknown> '' claimed on their website . The lack of hot water , was definitely not fine though . There were a couple <unknown> to our stay at Swissotel . The location is good , the bed was comfortable and the room was clean . These few good points certainly did not <unknown> our experience , and I would n't pick this place again , even <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I booked this hotel on Priceline for <unknown> , and a week later called the hotel directly to add <unknown> to our stay . The receptionist confirmed my reservation confirmation # and gave me a lower rate for both nights for the same king suite . When we arrived at check-in , there was no record of my <unknown> reservation whatsoever . The hotel was also fully booked , leaving my tired , <unknown> family and I high and dry with nowhere to go . The only decent thing that happened with this whole <unknown> was that <unknown> at the check-in desk called around to several other hotels <unknown> to find us a room , and seemed to be the only employee working at a very busy time of evening . We ended up at <unknown> Suites for both nights and had a very pleasant experience there . <stop>
<s> Stayed in old tower . Room was nice and room service was very good . Room Wi-Fi was expensive as was the bottled water . For the price of the room , at least there should at least have been water . I would rate the value as <unknown> . The restaurant menu was not great , food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire <unknown> In <unknown> , I will go to the <unknown> ... or <unknown> ... next time . Some of the above comments are based on a previous week <unknown> stay on the <unknown> <unknown> of North <unknown> and earlier this year in <unknown> California . <unknown> . If you are a fitness room <unknown> , the $ 16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel . <stop>
<s> I love this hotel . It is one of the best that I have stayed in . The lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable . The made services was terrific . No matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back . I asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly . That is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly . I was there with my daughter for a girl 's weekend from <unknown> - Sunday . Everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc . was wonderful . I ca n't say enough good about this hotel . Yes the bathroom was small , but I was n't moving into the room . I was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway . I will definitely stay there again <stop>
<s> I 'm sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room . The hotel is not modern in the least - it <unknown> like you 're staying in your <unknown> 's <unknown> . <unknown> is peeling off the wall , not well <unknown> , very few outlets in the room -- especially convenient ones ( none next to the bed or built into lamps ) , terrible views and loud construction <unknown> woke me up at <unknown> . Even the location is off the <unknown> <unknown> - <unknown> L stop is on the Red Line -- so not accessible via the loop stops on the <unknown> line from the airport without <unknown> . <unknown> club is not on site either . There are <unknown> of other hotels I would stay in over this one . <stop>
<s> This hotel has a great location , and very friendly staff . However , the <unknown> <unknown> of the property has certainly fallen behind the <unknown> . I use to be a regular at this hotel . . . but have not been back for 15 years . Rooms have not been well maintained ( old carpets <unknown> at doors ) , wall paper peeling off of the walls , TV 's from the 80 's . There is currently construction going on in the lobby area , making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door . <stop>
<s> We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before <unknown> . We had a corner room overlooking <unknown> Michigan Av and the Tribune Building . To say this is a 5 star hotel is to <unknown> this place with <unknown> <unknown> - it is wonderful . The staff were <unknown> helpful . The standard of the room was superb - <unknown> plasma <unknown> , luxury <unknown> , iPod radio , huge bathroom . Location is <unknown> - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> from the window . <unknown> were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service . Would have no hesitation <unknown> or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5 . <stop>
<s> The Conrad Hotel is a beautiful hotel . Our room was perfect and beautiful in every way . I was very impressed ( and I am hard to please and have high standards ) . It was so clean , <unknown> pleasing , up to date , just gorgeous ! I would definitely stay there again . I loved it . The location is superb too , attached to Nordstrom and <unknown> mall . Ca n't wait to go back ! <stop>
<s> Maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest - could n't get a room thru Fairmont website as busy weekend with <unknown> <unknown> ... <unknown> never have had this experience in using priceline before . The night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful . We were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a <unknown> room . We had comforter with dirt in several places - and a bathroom for <unknown> with no <unknown> space - had to use <unknown> board for toiletries . This hotel is huge and not at capacity - may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby . <unknown> , rooms , carpet run down - just not what you come to expect of a fairmont . I have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst . Maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updated ... we paid as much as other guest and I 'm a Fairmont Gold member . <unknown> - great location , <unknown> staff helpful at desk - they have two <unknown> to <unknown> which is handy . <unknown> could be great if you get a higher room . Checked out the <unknown> <unknown> across street - looked much nicer ! ! ! <stop>
<s> Stayed in a <unknown> Suite which was beautiful and spacious . It had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel ( great excuse to catch up on some <unknown> ) The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge <unknown> which was nice . The service was top notch . Stayed in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty . The <unknown> <unknown> was a complete waste of time and money but the Field <unknown> was amazing . Chicago <unknown> <unknown> with London as my <unknown> city . <stop>
<s> The location of this hotel is excellent . The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion . The room decor is horrible ( probably more European than I am used to ) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment . On the <unknown> , if you want to stay in a great location , feel safe , and can put up with some <unknown> issues and can get a great deal then this will work . I prefer Westin or Marriott ... something that you can <unknown> on . <stop>
<s> I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel , after <unknown> all the good things about it . Unfortunately , it was a very <unknown> experience , to say the least . But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel . First off , it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the <unknown> , <unknown> part of town that is Chicago 's <unknown> of Manhattan 's <unknown> East <unknown> , complete with <unknown> , quiet <unknown> streets , real <unknown> <unknown> ( instead of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> that are <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ) , cute <unknown> ( instead of <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> and other <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ) and , of course , <unknown> of <unknown> ( which <unknown> a separate mention ) . I also like the small <unknown> lobby area with old <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , area <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> . The very reason why I always <unknown> to <unknown> toward smaller boutique hotels instead of <unknown> chains . I definitely love the room . While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan , getting a <unknown> <unknown> for our weekend getaway is not an easy <unknown> . So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous , ample bathroom , double sink , <unknown> king bed AND still enough space to walk around , do a chicken <unknown> , and <unknown> my <unknown> and <unknown> in . My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely <unknown> to allow <unknown> to find its way into our <unknown> room , but then again <unknown> <unknown> is not exactly the <unknown> street in town and there are <unknown> in front of us , so ca n't have it all ! <unknown> one thing that really disappointed us was the service , or lack <unknown> . I mean , seriously . They do n't call it the <unknown> ' industry for no reason . I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more <unknown> than the kind that I would be getting from say , a <unknown> <unknown> hotel . First , I called in to <unknown> my reservation . The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent . First off , she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff , to whom I had to explain myself all over again ( my pet <unknown> when it comes to <unknown> customer service ) . The person who <unknown> the reception desk was not friendly , nor was he at all competent either . <unknown> in point - he had to send the <unknown> of paper on which I agree to the <unknown> rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in , which clearly <unknown> that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there . But the real <unknown> was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about <unknown> . As a general <unknown> , I am never , ever , a big fan of room service , having had my fair share of bad food that they <unknown> 18 % gratuity , <unknown> % tax ( and still expect a tip ) on during my days <unknown> on the company 's expense account . <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> soup , <unknown> hard enough to <unknown> someone out , and <unknown> that are already half <unknown> by the time it <unknown> your suite . So I really was n't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a <unknown> room service , but <unknown> and <unknown> , they do . I placed an order of chicken <unknown> , which ( to my initial <unknown> ) came in within 20 minutes . Then after the <unknown> of the <unknown> and the <unknown> yet <unknown> tip of $ 2 on top of the 18 % service fee ( refer above ) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin , <unknown> and served on a plate with a bag of <unknown> 's <unknown> ( <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ) . The <unknown> looked like someone <unknown> on it , the L and <unknown> looked like it was 2 days old , the <unknown> was <unknown> , and the chicken was <unknown> and cold . It was <unknown> room service at its <unknown> . We did get the <unknown> taken off our bill ( <unknown> so too ) but the front desk person was , instead of <unknown> , <unknown> . The whole thing was just very <unknown> and for a hotel as <unknown> as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving , it 's quite an <unknown> in and of itself . We wo n't be coming back , unfortunately . <stop>
<s> In from <unknown> and was hoping to stay on Michigan Ave at hotel . When we arrived we were told a previous guest had extended their stay so we did not have a room . The hotel moved us to another hotel 2 miles away in a less than <unknown> location . <unknown> on duty was unfriendly and even stated they would call security if we did not leave . They gave us $ 15 for cab fare . Will never stay there again . <unknown> to numerous guests the same weekend . <stop>
<s> `` <unknown> <unknown> Hotel at <unknown> <unknown> '' This hotel has a beautiful lobby but <unknown> to <unknown> to <unknown> its standards beyond the lobby . I have stayed in the Conrad in <unknown> , <unknown> and in <unknown> both of which I loved . I was looking forward to staying at this hotel . I was extremely disappointed . I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name . Pros : <unknown> lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location : <unknown> in the <unknown> of Chicago <unknown> - <unknown> and worn out carpet in hallway - Room was small - <unknown> and lightbulb in room were broken - Breakfast was $ 60 for two people , service was slow and <unknown> - Hotel <unknown> <unknown> and shampoo , one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days , I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel . and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct . I would not stay at this hotel again , It just is not worth the premium price they charge . <stop>
<s> i was in chicago from <unknown> <unknown> for a <unknown> my company booked this hotel for me . the hotel is centrally located , <unknown> <unknown> is less than a block away . perfect location ! the suites are huge with comfy beds and a beautiful <unknown> . breakfast is the best ... <unknown> not just muffins and toast ... i mean everything you can imagine ... <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , toast , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , all <unknown> made ... not <unknown> ... really good . and clean .. also they have a free dinner ... <unknown> excellent ... <unknown> night , <unknown> night , <unknown> <unknown> all <unknown> wine and beer <unknown> well worth the expensive price of $ <unknown> a night . a very classy and clean <unknown> i love chicago ... will come again ! <stop>
<s> We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less <unknown> . We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel , than some of the other larger high <unknown> hotels . We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel . When we checked <unknown> seemed very <unknown> and <unknown> . The front desk <unknown> were neither welcoming nor gracious . The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door . <unknown> time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff , just a <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> . The front desk staff was <unknown> and <unknown> , no <unknown> , no <unknown> and no personality . They had difficulty <unknown> simple questions or requests . On the other hand the bellman <unknown> was great . He was <unknown> and very service <unknown> . He was aware of what is going on in the area . He <unknown> the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area , and where to eat in the neighborhood . He is <unknown> and he even asked us upon our return `` how was that restaurant ? '' <unknown> the concierge was also <unknown> . He gave us 10 % discount <unknown> for shopping at the major department stores . We had the largest suite . We requested a rollaway ( extra charge ) when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after <unknown> . When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed . What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned . We were out of our room from <unknown> and when we returned to our room at <unknown> the rooms had not been cleaned . We called the front desk to ask to send someone . The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening . The room itself was pleasant . It did have a moldy smell and some <unknown> would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much . We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin . We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service . The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel . <stop>
<s> The Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway . The rooms are quiet , the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size . We had fabulous service and got a great rate . Other than the fact that there were no bathrobes ( it 's <unknown> as an amenity ) and the <unknown> radio did n't work , it was perfect . Would definitely stay there again ! <stop>
<s> <unknown> Chicago : Nice , but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern <unknown> in a great spot along the Chicago <unknown> . A spacious room is a comfortable <unknown> from the city , but do n't <unknown> in your computer or hope for a free <unknown> in the morning . No free WiFi here , or affordable breakfast , or a free swim in the pool . Just a <unknown> charge for internet , an on average $ 25 plate for breakfast , and another 15 bucks a night for the `` fitness center . '' I 've stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room . <unknown> with it - this is <unknown> ! No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and do n't need it anyway , but for those of us who are n't charging everything to the company card some <unknown> would be appreciated . <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> ; stale <unknown> , , muffins , maybe some <unknown> . <unknown> us a little something <unknown> fruit <unknown> water in the lobby . With <unknown> to swimming , this is another one <unknown> up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan <unknown> . This all makes the $ 6 <unknown> bottled water in the room seem like a bargain . <unknown> : <unknown> the fees , the <unknown> <unknown> of folks , and just charge what you need to charge to <unknown> what is otherwise a nice hotel . <stop>
<s> <unknown> The Talbot , especially for group <unknown> . My in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests . They were <unknown> in by promises from The Talbot , that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide `` special , personal treatment '' . Nothing could have been <unknown> from the truth . They failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception , they <unknown> confused reservation requests , they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly <unknown> of my guests , his wife , and his two year old daughter to miss their <unknown> flight . Now the worse part . <unknown> are made , even hotel managers are <unknown> , but where a hotel , which is supposed to be in the hospitality service , can <unknown> itself is in how they handle and correct the error . <unknown> in point : I had requested on several occasions when I made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card , all <unknown> , they <unknown> me that this would be no problem . Of course , when my brother , his wife , and <unknown> five year old arrived to <unknown> hot and <unknown> Chicago after <unknown> hours of travel they would n't let them check in until they physically saw my card ... again despite them having my card on record , and despite my <unknown> this to them over the phone . My brother <unknown> the `` <unknown> '' of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card . Then Another guest , in this case my older brother , came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could <unknown> the heat and the <unknown> waiting in the lobby . When I finally was able to get across town , leaving a <unknown> game early , I again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account . Again they agreed , but never did anything about it . In the end when my older brother checked out on Sunday he was told everything was alright , but when he went to his <unknown> his account was <unknown> from `` <unknown> <unknown> '' . The hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges <unknown> his account was essentially <unknown> . When he got home he had to take an entire day off to <unknown> with his bank how to rectify these events . I spent Sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on Monday , the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone , calling The Talbot , the credit card <unknown> <unknown> , my brother , etc trying to <unknown> this situation . The most <unknown> <unknown> continued to come form the <unknown> manager , who at one point suggested that `` I was <unknown> about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these <unknown> '' ... . this was a <unknown> event , and her <unknown> was that I was lying , and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake . In the end , there is no one running this place ... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . When I was finally able to get the name of the general manager ( after two days ) <unknown> neither he nor his <unknown> would ever call back . The <unknown> between the staff and <unknown> is <unknown> . <unknown> the staff at the <unknown> Room ( where we had the reception ) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost , but the The Talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests . <unknown> The Ambassador East ( same neighborhood ) cheaper , much more professional staff . <stop>
<s> Two main issues : ( 1 ) <unknown> from the street to the front desk . Unfortunately I had to drive into the city , when I arrived there was an <unknown> long wait for parking . Then inside , there was a huge <unknown> line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel . Not good ( I will say friendly however ) ( 2 ) I know this is a big city , but , $ <unknown> a night to park my car when I 'm staying at that hotel ? Really ? ? That 's <unknown> and a bit <unknown> in my opinion . Again , I <unknown> this is Chicago , but , I 'm already paying a <unknown> price for this outdated hotel . <stop>
<s> We arrived at <unknown> am on a Friday , and they had a room ready for us by <unknown> am , mind you check in is not until <unknown> . We got our room on Priceline for $ <unknown> per night and stayed 3 nights . We were upgraded - for free - to a suite . I think I was so blown away by that , that I forgot to thank them at check-in ! Our room was fantastic . It also had a wet bar and a fridge . The bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers . I knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini-bar . The bed and pillows were very comfortable . The room was very clean . Every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful . We stayed on the <unknown> floor of the east tower and had a quiet room . Yes , you could hear people in the hallways , but only because they were rude and were yelling . These were not children , they were adults . I do n't know why everyone <unknown> about $ 48 for parking . This is Chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much , some without <unknown> <unknown> . We did n't use any of the restaurants or the health club . We tried to eat at the Corner <unknown> but it was too crowded . Breakfast at nearby <unknown> 's had a buffet for $ <unknown> per person . Also the grocery store behind the hotel is great . There is a 7-11 not too far away . I do n't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel . Yes , it 's a big hotel . If you do n't want a busy lobby , do n't stay in a <unknown> plus room hotel ! ! I loved the Hotel and would recommend it to anyone . Not one problem . Was n't too busy for me . Would stay here again in a <unknown> . <stop>
<s> We just arrived from a 3 nights stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower . It was <unknown> . <unknown> <unknown> , nice room with <unknown> windows , bathroom with a shower , flat TV . Check for the deals on the Sofitel website , we had 3 nights for the price of two ! <stop>
<s> I had purchased this deal of off <unknown> . <unknown> just say we found a bunch of <unknown> <unknown> . when We <unknown> down to sleep in our bed . We <unknown> our blanket and found very <unknown> <unknown> on our bed ( attached in photos ) , we <unknown> called the front desk . The only thing they offered was a new set of sheets . when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and <unknown> changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again . we <unknown> since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean . Then next day i <unknown> showed the <unknown> desk and manager the photos , and they offered me a ( $ <unknown> ) refund . I was very <unknown> , and dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and <unknown> and I <unknown> out on my face with <unknown> ( i never had a <unknown> or skin issues ) <unknown> positive something in those <unknown> sheets . We drove 4.5 hours to enjoy Chicago and we stayed @ the hard rock based on <unknown> , and <unknown> we were very <unknown> . it was <unknown> ! I then wrote a <unknown> to management and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . NOT even a response or apology . I just really expected <unknown> more . <stop>
<s> We 've just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and our visit was <unknown> . Thanks to <unknown> reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the <unknown> and <unknown> was a mess . And the hotel restaurant and bar <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> . Even <unknown> of the lobby had `` wet paint '' <unknown> . All these things could have made for a disappointing stay . Not so ! ! Although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff . After just a few minutes we felt like we were `` at home . '' The suite on the <unknown> floor , with a <unknown> view along a wall of windows , was <unknown> fresh and clean . The bathroom lighting was outstanding and <unknown> to my <unknown> of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look <unknown> ... she was right ! Everything in and about the room was `` <unknown> '' and very stylish . As a <unknown> we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the Magnificient Mile and all of its ambiance . Thanks to a <unknown> and gracious staff , a fantastic location , and chic <unknown> <unknown> , this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in Chicago . The stay was <unknown> sweet . <stop>
<s> The room itself was fine and comfortable ( very <unknown> ) , but the customer service by the <unknown> , concierge or `` experience something or the others '' left much to be desired . First , I arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk . I was not greeted with the usual `` <unknown> , welcome to ... '' . Instead , I got , `` <unknown> name ? <unknown> ? '' No , `` <unknown> '' , no `` welcome to the Amalfi Hotel , '' just plain old poor customer service from the very <unknown> ! That left a very bad taste in my mouth , but I decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was . <stop>
<s> Me , My sister and my best friend all went to stay here in the summer of 2004 ... they said there all spacious suites ... yeah right ... our room you could barely walk in ... and they said <unknown> 2 double beds ... yeah well one was a pull out couch ... and the bathroom ... tiny tiny tiny ... and it took forever and a day to check in and the people <unknown> us for <unknown> a book out the window and somehow someone knew exactly where it fell from and which room ... yeah ... i wouldnt stay here again <stop>
<s> As we pulled away in a taxi <unknown> to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said `` We picked the right place . '' Having chosen the Talbott from other Trip Advisor reviews I found myself thinking in terms of a Trip Advisor review when we arrived . Nice entrance , friendly reception , I noticed everything and immediately knew the Talbott was a <unknown> warm hotel with touches not <unknown> seen in big name hotel chains . The smell of the elevator and attention to <unknown> <unknown> strongly reminded me of Europe , simple , not <unknown> but elegant . The location is great , there was light <unknown> but we walked to the Art Institute , Rush Street , the <unknown> <unknown> , and we 're from California where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside ! All I can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort , class and somewhere unique , stay at the Talbott . Oh yeah , we were in a room that looked down at the construction , we were on the <unknown> floor and could not hear a sound , it was very quiet . <stop>
<s> My wife and I just spent the <unknown> Day weekend in the city , choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our <unknown> . We 've stayed at the HRH in <unknown> twice and are blown away by the ambience there . It 's not that way here . These may be all <unknown> <unknown> things , but they added up to us . First of all , the room . We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with `` an <unknown> view '' . Well , our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the <unknown> on top of the building next to us . That was all we could see . So there was no view . The room was <unknown> . We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below <unknown> . We woke up <unknown> both days . When we opened the window to get a breeze , the noise from the rooftop next to us was <unknown> . The room was small and dark , but it did n't bother us that much . The bed may have been the <unknown> comfortable bed I ever slept in . And we even <unknown> about <unknown> the pillows ! We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous <unknown> , but they removed the charges no <unknown> . <unknown> the entire hotel , I <unknown> a total of 3 <unknown> of music <unknown> . I thought it was a pretty <unknown> <unknown> to <unknown> an old hotel , throw a <unknown> <unknown> on the wall , and <unknown> a HRH <unknown> on the outside . The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation . The location is good , right on the south end of the <unknown> mile , but there are <unknown> better hotels in a better location to shopping , quality <unknown> , and Navy Pier . If you have a car , parking will cost you $ <unknown> , which is <unknown> normal for downtown . The hotel restaurant was a <unknown> restaurant . The bar was small and trendy , and I guess the <unknown> to it all was that my wife tried to order a <unknown> <unknown> and they told us they did n't have a <unknown> . <unknown> ? ? ? ? A HRH without a <unknown> ? Did they not know that <unknown> <unknown> was in town ? ? ? ? Mind <unknown> ! I would never , never , never go back here . <unknown> I said , there are many better hotels in much better locations . I will stay at the HRH in <unknown> or elsewhere again . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night to do some <unknown> , <unknown> shopping . It really is a great hotel . The rooms are really cool , and we were just in the basic one . The bed is extremely comfortable , with the <unknown> sheets and great pillows . The <unknown> in the room is great . They have nice upscale <unknown> in the bathrooms . For a very modern room , it is still comfortable and <unknown> . The location is perfect for getting <unknown> you want to go . The staff were very nice and helpful . The bar is really funky with an interesting martini menu . One of the best hotels I have stayed at in Chicago . Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend . <stop>
<s> My girlfriends and I stayed 4 nights at the Talbott returning home on Saturday <unknown> . We all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel . The staff from top to bottom were excellent , accommodating . The room was roomy ... with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town . The construction next door was <unknown> the sidewalk , but being on a <unknown> street limited that difficulty . The doorman , <unknown> was an excellent <unknown> at this hotel . He arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants . We enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city . The hotel was expensive but met expectations . <stop>
<s> We booked our room on Priceline , and got a good deal at around $ 100 per night . We stayed for the first 2 nights of our <unknown> trip so didnt use too many of the hotel 's facilities The hotel is centrally located , just over the Chicago River from the shops at North Michigan Avenue , and around a mile from Navy Pier Our room was clean and comfortable , and on the 29th floor we had a good view of the city , and could just about see Lake Michigan ( though the weather was very bad ) . The layout of the room is a little <unknown> , with the bed facing away from the window , but over all we have no complaints about this hotel , and <unknown> some other reviews we were not <unknown> at all by noise from other guests So , <unknown> and <unknown> : Pros : <unknown> and friendly staff <unknown> and comfortable throughout <unknown> rooms Large and <unknown> public areas Starbucks and gift <unknown> in lobby Cons A large hotel , so a long walk from the elevators to the front desk / lobby area <stop>
<s> My first trip back to Chicago in about 7 years was perfect ! I chose the Knickerbocker as I had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to Michigan Avenue , Rush Street and downtown Chicago . I must say I was very impressed with the guestrooms ! I had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a <unknown> from what I 've seen in photo 's posted on the reviews . The guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a <unknown> hotel ! The beds are wonderful -- I need to get a pillow top mattress at home ! I used the Internet access with no issue and I LOVED the larger screen TV 's . The shower is fun with the different types of shower <unknown> you can choose . And the bathrooms are fresh with all new <unknown> and <unknown> . I 'm <unknown> to get back to Chicago and it wo n't be 7 years from now ! I would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms , location and staff ! I 've added some <unknown> pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one 's I saw on previous reviews with the new renovation . <stop>
<s> We have just returned from 4 nights at the Conrad Chicago , <unknown> about the hotel was excellent . <unknown> room and service from all the staff was first class . Great view from our room . The hotels location is great , right in the centre of the magnificent mile . A wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the Conrad . <stop>
<s> My wife and I <unknown> some of my Hilton <unknown> <unknown> to stay a few nights at the Palmer House . The hotel is absolutely beautiful . From the moment you walk into the lobby you can tell that this place is nice . As we were <unknown> members we got upgraded to a suite which was great because we were provided access to their executive lounge ( free food & drinks ) . The service was excellent and the location of the hotel is within walking distance of many sights on the south side of Chicago . I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone interested in coming to Chicago . <stop>
<s> Stayed for 3 nights for our anniversary . The desk clerk was great and since it was our anniversary , he gave us an upgrade ... imagine our surprise when we got off on a floor with only 3 other rooms ! Corner tower suite with a view of the river and Michigan <unknown> Beautiful ! <unknown> available right outside the lobby ... Never paid more than $ 7 for a cab ride . If you go in <unknown> you must go to the <unknown> <unknown> for <unknown> ! <stop>
<s> I decided to book at the Amalfi after <unknown> a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on TA . I was blown away by the reviews for the Amalfi on TA and decided to check it out . I was able to <unknown> a great price on the hotel room and I was not disappointed . I asked to be put in a quiet room because I was having an interview the next day . The room was very quiet and in a great location , but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and I could hear people running on the treadmill during the day . However , it <unknown> down at night and I could not hear anything . The rooms were enormous for Chicago and I was pleased ! ! ! The hotel provided free breakfast which was good , free internet , and free gym access . The hotel is only a few blocks from the Magnificient Mile and I walked there <unknown> to do shopping . I have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly . I wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was . All in all , I plan to stay at the Amalfi anytime I visit Chicago in the future . <stop>
<s> We stayed 2 nights at the Knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay . The hotel has recently renovated there rooms . The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from <unknown> and <unknown> at the martini bar to <unknown> at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us . The hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that Chicago offers . Our pick for THE <unknown> is the Knickerbocker . <unknown> and <unknown> . <stop>
<s> Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend . The staff was wonderful , room was beautiful and location great . You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel . Very close to museums and restaurants . I have stayed here before and it always <unknown> to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago . <stop>
<s> Great location and quality place to stay . Lovely large clean room with a queen size bed it was great . Staff were very helpful and put us onto some great restaurants and then some music bars . <unknown> on the front desk was a great guy to meet as a first impression he sold the hotel to us with his personality . The hotel delivered an anniversary cake to us in our room ( <unknown> of the hotel ) for me this showed that they care about their guests Many thanks to all it was a great place to stay . <stop>
<s> We booked this hotel using points on our credit card . When we arrived , we were immediately greeted by a friendly face . We arrived several hours before check-in . However , they let us check-in early . They also gave us a free room upgrade . The hotel is absolutely stunning ! In addition , it is off of State Street . There are many things to do - shopping , <unknown> , theater . It is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the <unknown> <unknown> or the airport . The hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge . The room was so dark and quiet we slept in . <stop>
<s> Nice big rooms but <unknown> mildew hallways , fair room service menu and <unknown> elevator set up really <unknown> my review on the Omni . Location was great but there are a lot of other options . If you get a really good deal on the room , I would n't say no . <stop>
<s> The staff <unknown> you by name with excellent <unknown> contact . The `` welcome back '' <unknown> the tone for your stay . <unknown> in the lobby and reception area beautiful . The <unknown> staff is terrific , helpful and prompt . Room service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too . Pump Room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients . Well done ! <stop>
<s> I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago . I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times . She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first . The `` night manager '' at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation . ( this was <unknown> mistake ) They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived . They did nothing to try and help me until I <unknown> there and complained for twenty minutes . I ca n't believe that a `` manager '' would treat a customer this way . There are other great hotels in Chicago . This hotel is not worth the <unknown> ! <stop>
<s> My husband and I were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website , when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4 , easily changed . First morning cold , cold shower , did n't complain , next day fine . <unknown> did not work , called every day to complain , and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room , never was . No <unknown> tone , unable to call restaurant , or call for car or call for room service . Finally , on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it . The hotel is beautiful , rooms great and everyone was so nice , even when I was complaining they were nice . Great gym area also , and love the restaurant . <unknown> , for the money I could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone . <stop>
<s> We became an Ambassador member just before spending Mother 's day at the Chicago Intercontinental , and received a room upgrade to an exceptional room . Our Saturday night stay was the <unknown> $ 99 we ever spent ( Mother 's day special ) . The welcoming chocolate covered <unknown> began the weekend on a high note ; the concierge continued it by <unknown> a wonderful dinner ( <unknown> priced ) , and the great Sunday breakfast <unknown> it all off . All in all , Mother 's day in Chicago was <unknown> . We loved it enough to be back for <unknown> Day weekend ( another `` package '' ) . <stop>
<s> We stayed 6 <unknown> days in this not too big and very friendly hotel . the rooms were spotless comfortable and great view too ... also nice view from the <unknown> . The area is pleasant nice and clean , minute walk to <unknown> mile , easy to walk around to the lake . friendly stuff , very clean , great warm hotel to stay in . it does not have the `` big hotel '' <unknown> feeling - more like home : ) <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Hard Rock on January <unknown> , <unknown> for $ <unknown> . It is located on Michigan Ave , just two blocks from the Mag Mile , two blocks from Millenium Park , and five blocks from the Chicago Art Institute . Our hotel room was very nice with views of Michigan Ave and a <unknown> comfy bed . The hotel even offered free coffee in the lobby every morning and free wifi in the rooms . Parking was $ 45 for valet and $ 30 for <unknown> parking . The staff was very helpful with all of our request . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was <unknown> to a conference I was attending . Before I arrived I tried to find out about the `` In Room Fitness '' program advertised on the corporate website . I called the 800 reservation number and the <unknown> service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center . I explained that I was <unknown> about the <unknown> Room Fitness ' advertised on their website . She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly . I did and got the same response . I asked if they could <unknown> a treadmill for my room . Again , this was a problem . When I arrived at the hotel , no treadmill was available . When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at <unknown> . When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge $ 13 per day to use the fitness equipment . The pool , track and locker room are free , but to use the <unknown> , etc . you have to pay $ 13 per day . This charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website , not in any of the guest service materials in the room . The food for the conference was mediocre , but the one room service meal I had was pretty good . During one of the conference lunch <unknown> the wait staff made so much noise we could n't hear the <unknown> . The <unknown> did n't work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay . The beds were comfortable with very nice linens . I tried to get a late checkout , which was offered on a card in my room . The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour , not the <unknown> range advertised in my room . The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office . The hotel does not have <unknown> in guest rooms , so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my <unknown> between conference <unknown> and every other time I could n't carry it out of the hotel . I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties . Only wish I had done so for this visit . <stop>
<s> We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip . I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick <unknown> , then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff . Well , our stay here <unknown> 1 night and we quickly , and thankfully , switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights . The room was dirty . When we opened the <unknown> , the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and <unknown> that fell out . <unknown> considering this is a suite hotel where the <unknown> are <unknown> used , and <unknown> cleaned , a lot . <unknown> blankets were also dirty and bathrooms were n't much better . <unknown> control in the room was <unknown> - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night , it made for a cold stay . If you like to eat for free ( they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights ) and do n't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer , I guess some may find this place <unknown> . But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden <unknown> . The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area ( we switched to The James and had a great experience ) . I could n't be paid to stay here again . I 'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience . <stop>
<s> The James hotel is located close to everything in Chicago , the miracle mile , <unknown> House <unknown> , Rush street , The Water Tower everything . We walked everywhere because everything was close by . The rooms are very modern and a little on the small side . But the bed was very comfortable , Very ! The service is very good and the calls are answered <unknown> and nicely . All service was very fast and through . The lobby is a <unknown> small but that keeps the <unknown> <unknown> from hanging out in it , the bar service was good . The drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar . I got a great deal from <unknown> hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over $ <unknown> for a 5 star hotel that 's cheap . <unknown> to the location , price and service I may stay there again . But I think my next trip may take me to Trump 's hotel in <unknown> Town . The James is a good stay . The doorman at the hotel are Great ! Always <unknown> , with a smile and very good service . <stop>
<s> The bathroom toilet <unknown> water all over the bathroom every time it was <unknown> , so we called maintenance to have it fixed . We returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in <unknown> . There were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our <unknown> towels to clean their <unknown> and <unknown> . We love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again . <stop>
<s> Other reviews complain about the small rooms . For a major city , we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings . One feature we liked is the ability to open the window . The <unknown> is a small boutique hotel right off Michigan Avenue in the best area of Chicago . The staff was friendly and helpful . For the $ <unknown> we paid on Hotwire , we could not have found a better room in downtown Chicago . <stop>
<s> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , off to Chicago we go . Here 's the <unknown> , if you 're hoping to run into a <unknown> up rock star ( <unknown> <unknown> for us , and no the <unknown> had no idea who he was ) you may want to spend your hard <unknown> money here . I took my <unknown> sister and a couple of her friends ( <unknown> ) for an <unknown> in Chicago on our way to <unknown> . I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance . I mean come on it is supposed to be `` <unknown> '' . Well it was n't . The <unknown> : <unknown> is in the <unknown> & <unknown> Building , which is beautiful . *The location : it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use . *The fitness center is very nice . <unknown> machines have <unknown> TV 's and there are head phones in case you forgot <unknown> . They have <unknown> bars for those that like them for a post workout snack . <unknown> and out was quick and Valet was very courteous . The <unknown> : *The rooms were small and ours was n't clean ( <unknown> <unknown> on the floor ) . The rooms were painted <unknown> <unknown> ( we were on the <unknown> floor ) with a picture of <unknown> <unknown> hanging on one of the walls . The girls thought the <unknown> part about the hotel was the <unknown> throw pillows . <unknown> had only a shower and not a full tub . *The <unknown> reception was poor ; I kept looking for the <unknown> <unknown> to fix the picture . <unknown> is n't anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe . <unknown> was very little <unknown> . <unknown> is no pool , and yes I knew this when I made the reservation . To <unknown> it up , I wo n't be staying here again . If I am going to <unknown> almost 4 <unknown> on a hotel room , I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton . But that is a whole different review . <stop>
<s> we stayed here in <unknown> when it was <unknown> but even then we enjoyed it so much we could not wait to get back . chicago is a great town to visit and the <unknown> suites is the place to stay , period . now we stayed from the <unknown> to <unknown> and enjoyed every day . ( <unknown> . the weather was in the high <unknown> ) . to get back to the hotel , it was fantastic , it has everything you need and its write in the heart of the city . two seperate rooms were very handy as we had our teenage son . full kitchen , ( <unknown> on 7th floor ) <unknown> <unknown> within walking distance , everything within walking distance . you wont need a car and at $ 42 for valet parking you wont want one . dont take my word for it , check it out you wont be disappointed . oh and did i mention free breakfast and dinner . job done . its a no <unknown> book now . <unknown> . <unknown> also a beach within walking distance <stop>
<s> Location , location , location . What a great find ! Excellent , <unknown> , small <unknown> hotel on a <unknown> street near all the <unknown> without being in the <unknown> <unknown> of it . Rooms are <unknown> and clean ; good bed and shower with tub . The air conditioner , as mentioned in other reviews , is noisy , but it 's a minor complaint . The staff is simply wonderful and attentive from <unknown> to concierge . The on site restaurant is great . The <unknown> El is about <unknown> blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze . You are <unknown> away from Rush Street and North Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan . I would not have a moment 's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future ; in fact , I would n't book anywhere else . <stop>
<s> Stayed at the Amalfi hotel in Chicago this month with good expectations . And what a disappointment ! <unknown> just under $ 200 for a `` deluxe king '' , and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction , a dirty , badly `` <unknown> '' bathroom , <unknown> sheets , no down comforter ! ! ( just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing ) , previously opened bottles in our mini bar , and plenty of rude , <unknown> staff members & managers ( <unknown> . not a 3 or 4 star <unknown> ! ! ) I do live in Chicago , and have stayed at a wide range of places . I know that for $ 200 in February , you can expect a great hotel . As there were many available the weekend we stayed at Amalfi , choosing it over say , the Palmer House Hilton , Hotel <unknown> , Sutton Place , Hotel <unknown> , was a huge waste . Definitely keep looking and book elsewhere . Not worth the price at all , do n't let their pictures <unknown> you . Also , I would n't say that our experience was just a <unknown> <unknown> , the hotel looks like an old <unknown> Inn that had <unknown> a <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> , new lamps . <stop>
<s> Spent three nights in Chicago at this property . First of all , I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants , the Art Institute and <unknown> Hall . The hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new <unknown> . The rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired . This property needs to be renovated . Some <unknown> : The junior suite I had was laid out <unknown> . A small bedroom and smaller sitting room <unknown> by a <unknown> off of which was the very large bathroom . The mirror over the sink was not over the sink but <unknown> to the right - made <unknown> a <unknown> and <unknown> . While <unknown> in the elevator one morning , it started <unknown> so <unknown> that I could barely stand up . It stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a <unknown> shut it down . ( This experience was far more <unknown> than coffee in <unknown> me wake up - an <unknown> <unknown> certainly <unknown> <unknown> ! ) <unknown> from my group were of <unknown> stopped up , exposed <unknown> in rooms , and generally things not working . Now the good news - the staff is terrific . They make you feel welcome , are <unknown> , have their own <unknown> , great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help . I wish they had a better property to work in . <stop>
<s> I travel to chicago quite often , and have stayed at a bunch of hotels . I stayed at Conrad a couple of times . My impression was not too good . Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I did n't feel welcome at all . The room was noisy . <unknown> walls , and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about . One time the tv was broken too , and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it ... <unknown> , given that this is a 4.5 star hotel , it really didnt live up to my expectations . After the <unknown> time at this hotel , I thought I might give it a second try . After the 2nd time , I decided I am really not coming back , especially given that there are so many other hotels close by . The other <unknown> of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel . So I guess I am not alone in this ... <stop>
<s> Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for 3 nights in early April 2007 . Very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the Golden Mile . Good restaurant at the hotel serving a <unknown> <unknown> breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice <unknown> <unknown> . <unknown> at the restaurant was also good . <unknown> are reasonable . Room is comfortable , only problem was with a card access door <unknown> that usually required several <unknown> before opening . Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff . Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago . Concierge recommended a small <unknown> tour , which was excellent . However early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the <unknown> of Chicago was not operating yet . <stop>
<s> The hotel is <unknown> situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park . It is an `` old classic '' of a hotel , and the main lobby is a must see , but I would not stay there again . The problem with any hotel <unknown> from long ago ( the current one was built in <unknown> ) is that , even with <unknown> <unknown> ( which was done in <unknown> ) it is hard to <unknown> <unknown> that are comparable to what is expected today ( in many cases the walls are <unknown> <unknown> so can not be changed too much ) . We had a reasonably sized room ( king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair ) but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries . Also , there was no coffee machine in the room - something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days . My major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge . It is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors <unknown> in the evening along with a <unknown> wine at a <unknown> price . ( Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program , we get access for free at the <unknown> but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt . ) At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine ( there was a bartender on duty ) and was slightly surprised by the cost - $ <unknown> which came to $ <unknown> for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine . It was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years . I did n't think it was even as good as <unknown> <unknown> 's cheapest $ <unknown> wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago . Unfortunately I did n't get a look at the bottle to see what it was ( although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a <unknown> ) . I noticed that a couple of <unknown> in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and I can understand <unknown> at the prices they were charging . It then <unknown> to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time . I checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red <unknown> by the glass - the same three <unknown> as at the bar . The <unknown> was a <unknown> <unknown> at $ <unknown> from room service . I <unknown> that what I had had at some time been a <unknown> <unknown> that had been left to turn to <unknown> . It was slightly more expensive from room service , but I hope that it was in a lot better <unknown> . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the Intercontinental for three nights last weekend . It is a located in a fantastic spot on the Magnificent Mile , right near the Chicago River and the <unknown> building . We had a double room in the main tower . The room was very clean and updated . The staff were very friendly and helpful . The <unknown> about this hotel is that you have to pay extra to use the fitness centre and internet access . Also , parking is high ( $ 45 <unknown> ) . Overall , we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel . We paid $ <unknown> on Priceline and felt that this was a reasonable price . <stop>
<s> While the parking service was great - the front desk was terrible . We had a huge problem getting ice one night - we had none in our room so we went twice to get some - no one was there to help , called the front desk they promised to deliver some - none arrived so we called again - they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened . ... read more <stop>
<s> Arrived on <unknown> , greeted by friendly doorman , and <unknown> up to the 5th <unknown> Lobby . Very open lobby area with friendly reception staff . Room was on the <unknown> <unknown> and very nice . Everything was in order and very clean ! The king size bed was nice and each night I had a restful sleep . Bathroom was large with separate glass shower <unknown> . The room was furnished with everything I needed including internet <unknown> access . Also , you can walk thru on the 5th <unknown> to the <unknown> North <unknown> Shopping <unknown> , where you will enjoy Nordstrom and other stores . Of course , you 're steps from Michigan Ave. too . The central location of the hotel was great , as I could walk to most places . The CTA <unknown> stop ( <unknown> Ave. on Red Line ) was an easy 2 block walk . I will stay here again on my next trip to Chicago ! <stop>
<s> We had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well . They were <unknown> to a brief staff <unknown> and did not <unknown> guests and in fact failed to tell us about the <unknown> and our room never was cleaned . After 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels . Overall service other than check in was poor for a <unknown> 4 star hotel . <stop>
<s> The hotel definitely does n't <unknown> its 4.5 rating . The receptionist was very unhelpful and <unknown> , and I do n't feel welcome at all . I booked a non-smoking room , but upon arrival , the receptionist told me that there was no non-smoking room left . Of course he was lying . I <unknown> with him for 5 minutes , before he reluctantly gave me a non-smoking room . At checkout , they tried to charge me $ 40 upgrade fee each day , because I requested a non-smoking room . This was completely ridiculous . I had to go <unknown> with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges . The room was quite small , the TV was broken , so I had to call someone to fix the TV . Then the wireless <unknown> <unknown> my <unknown> address , so I had to talk to their <unknown> -- the <unknown> <unknown> was quite friendly , knowledgeable and helpful -- I guess this was the only bright point of the stay . <stop>
<s> We stayed here as an <unknown> spot for a friend 's wedding . The price was about 50 % to 65 % of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area . First the <unknown> . 1 . ) The standard rooms are small . if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade . 2 . ) Since the hotel has been recently <unknown> you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted . 3 . ) There really are no views from the hotel . Now the <unknown> . 1 . ) The shower is <unknown> . <unknown> one of the best hotel showers I 've seen . <unknown> shower with <unknown> , great pressure and the <unknown> did n't <unknown> like a lot of these shower <unknown> do . Very nice . 2 . ) The fixtures and <unknown> in the rooms were top notch . Very modern and clean . 3 . ) The bed was great . <unknown> than some hotels that <unknown> their beds . Great nights sleep . Overall . This is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room . If you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work . <unknown> else should really like the experience . All I care about when I travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to <unknown> in after a long day . If you are the same this is a good spot for you . <stop>
<s> If location is the only thing that <unknown> , stay at the Talbott . However , my wife and I have <unknown> <unknown> throughout North <unknown> and Europe , and I have never , in my entire life , seen such an <unknown> housekeeping staff . They are unprofessional , noisy , incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel . They were yelling in the <unknown> , <unknown> doors , and taking far too long to clean each room . They come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for $ 3 . The hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to <unknown> the construction work - no discount was offered even after we complained several times . The front desk staff was very polite , but who <unknown> ? They 're supposed to be nice . I spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal . The room was <unknown> for the price , even for an <unknown> city hotel . Stay somewhere else and have a better vacation . <stop>
<s> Stayed here for two days in the first week in January , when hotel was very quiet . Got a big corner room . Staff are friendly , decor is modern , and there 's a huge choice of pastries and <unknown> and breads for breakfast , which you take back to your room . The free hors <unknown> with the drinks are great <unknown> - <unknown> , breads , cheeses and <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> . This was a really easy hotel to stay in , fairly central - a couple of blocks away from the ' L ' , and quiet , despite the building work opposite . If you 're in Chicago , stay here . <stop>
<s> I am not much of a <unknown> , as you can see when <unknown> my other <unknown> on this site , but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to <unknown> future <unknown> to Chicago : My <unknown> and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July <unknown> . The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone . The receptionist was <unknown> rude , but took the reservation without a mistake . During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was <unknown> incompetent , the waiters , the managers , nobody was friendly , nor <unknown> to <unknown> us . [ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to <unknown> open from <unknown> to have an after hour 's party . The hotel manager had assured us that this was <unknown> and done in the past upon such occasions . When we returned from the reception at <unknown> the bar was <unknown> and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends . `` <unknown> told us , we ca n't do anything for you . '' `` <unknown> you sure that you arranged this ? '' Two <unknown> so <unknown> for this hotel 's staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again . I understand that <unknown> are made and that <unknown> can be difficult across different <unknown> in a hotel , but <unknown> the customer so being confused and <unknown> to <unknown> what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste .

<s> On a recent trip to Chicago to attend a major <unknown> show I had the pleasure of staying with the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower . I say stay with as that is how they make you feel , from check in to check out they go above and beyond to <unknown> your stay is perfect and you want to return . The rooms are clean , chic and roomy , the beds - the best I have slept in , bathrooms large and super clean . What can I say , my new home when in Chicago ... <stop>
<s> I stayed here with a dozen of my friends , and more than half of us got eaten <unknown> by bed bugs ! We stayed there from September <unknown> - September <unknown> , but the <unknown> ( <unknown> . the crazy <unknown> ) did n't come until Sunday night when we all got home . I complained to the hotel and basically all they 're <unknown> <unknown> do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning <unknown> . <unknown> , they should <unknown> us , because it was not worth it at all . DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! ! ! <stop>
<s> where do I start . The GM was a nice guy for <unknown> the incident I had . Anthony <unknown> Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was <unknown> . Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice . He set me up and <unknown> me a price of $ <unknown> , When i got to the spa ( which was actually a <unknown> <unknown> and hair <unknown> ) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $ 100 with 20 % off . At the end of the massage I gave the lady $ 100 and said thanks you can keep the change , She insisted that I got `` A Hotel <unknown> '' because Anthony set me up . She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $ 45 . She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I <unknown> . In short - <unknown> <unknown> with this place . I was quite taken back . The GM <unknown> <unknown> 'd me a night but , I felt <unknown> big time . Stay somewhere else . The concierge has something going on ... <stop>
<s> This hotel does not <unknown> in the same <unknown> as The Peninsula , Four Seasons , or Ritz Carlton . It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel . Staff was very nice and attentive , but the lobby is cramped , and only two small elevators for 17 floors ! ! <unknown> times the elevator was full by the time it <unknown> our floor , and we were forced to take the stairs . The hotel must be <unknown> the travel <unknown> itself with high reviews . <stop>
<s> We stayed at Hotel Monaco and upgraded to a suite . I was disappointed with the room layout , and shabby furniture . I <unknown> into the coffee table and the top almost <unknown> to the ground . The make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work , the TV reception was very poor and overall the room just <unknown> worth the $ <unknown> we spent there . Next time , we will go back to Trump Tower across the street , which is far superior to Hotel Monaco . <stop>
<s> I love the Ambassador East , true , she 's a little old but she 's a classic <unknown> . The service is wonderful , from the minute you arrive you are greeted warmly and with a nice welcome ! I felt the service was good , room was clean and quiet and that all the staff was very accomodating . The biggest gem is the Pump Room bar and restaurant . The best drinks , amazing food , <unknown> <unknown> and fun music on the weekends . This is set in the most fabulous location ; <unknown> <unknown> , close to walk the <unknown> , well <unknown> <unknown> bars , excellent restaurants Chicago has to offer and most of all shopping . There was a nice street <unknown> going on over the <unknown> weekends , giving this area a real interesting <unknown> of Chicago . I can see it needs some updating but I was totally happy and <unknown> with my stay . I travel a great deal in my work and have seen all <unknown> of hotels . I will stay here again in the future . <stop>
<s> I love the free breakfast and <unknown> on <unknown> . The hotel is clean and nice rooms The pool needs some updating ( but kids do n't care ) My friend and I took our <unknown> for a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> and this hotel was perfect <stop>
<s> Thank god I got this hotel through priceline . I ca n't imagine paying full price for this place . The tub was moldy and dingy . The toilet did n't flush . Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least . <unknown> you wanted to pay $ 5 for a <unknown> of an <unknown> show . Oh , and internet ? Why that will set you back about $ 15 for the day . And breakfast ? That 's about $ 16 for a cup of coffee , a croissant and two <unknown> of <unknown> . This hotel is the <unknown> . The customer service is ... <unknown> ! When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby ( <unknown> out like some bad late 80 's <unknown> ) there 's no one to <unknown> you upstairs to the check in . And once you 're there , check in is very fast , i 'll <unknown> them that . This hotel is a big , <unknown> <unknown> . I will never stay here ( and will <unknown> clear of <unknown> in general I believe ) . <stop>
<s> We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters <unknown> a part business , part family fun trip in July . We were very impressed with the location , within walking distance to great <unknown> and shopping , <unknown> Water Tower Place ( a great mall ! ) . We were quite disappointed with the room <unknown> and size . The <unknown> were filthy and so thin . The room decor is in <unknown> need of an <unknown> . The bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew . The shower actually had mold in the <unknown> ! This was a very tight <unknown> for 4 people . <unknown> the bathroom . The beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable . Even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people ! Thank <unknown> there were a few elevators . Luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price . The only <unknown> was the great location . Also <unknown> its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle ! Millenium <unknown> the airport shuttle but take a cab ! <stop>
<s> We just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House . We normally stay north on the Mag Mile but wanted to be closer to <unknown> 's <unknown> and the Art <unknown> this time . We were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the Four Seasons two weeks earlier . What a suite ! ! It was huge . The basic living room , dining room and <unknown> bar area was one large room . <unknown> to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of <unknown> doors . All rooms were <unknown> clean . They even smelled good . Lovely <unknown> , robes , etc . Lots of large closets . The bathrooms were older but well maintained . Much better than the ones at the Four Seasons . The furniture was nice but worn in some <unknown> . The beds and linens were excellent . Room service was fast . The food and service were great . The pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained . We had one small problem with a <unknown> out lightbulb in one of the lamps . <unknown> arrived quickly with a new <unknown> . They would n't allow me to tip them ! ! Check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks . This is a very large hotel , so they have to move a lot of people and rooms . Also , the hotel does not have views as it is <unknown> like an `` <unknown> '' . All in all , the Palmer House is a good value for the money . <stop>
<s> We went to Chicago to see an <unknown> at the Art Institute and <unknown> the Fairmont because it was so close . Although the lobby is still being renovated , our experience at the hotel was <unknown> positive . The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate . The only <unknown> involved getting the room coffee replenished . The maid does not do that , and by <unknown> on the first night , we still did n't have coffee . We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply . The restaurant is a little <unknown> , but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks , we probably would n't have eaten there any more than we did . After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels , this may be the hotel we return to <unknown> we return . <stop>
<s> Before booking this hotel , I did read the reviews , and I was concerned . I ended up booking it based on my <unknown> <unknown> . <unknown> <unknown> ! ! The temperature in Chicago was a <unknown> 99 degrees , and the temp in the room that they gave us was about <unknown> degrees . When we called to complain at <unknown> am , they told us to turn the temp down to <unknown> . We went back at <unknown> . it was still <unknown> , the beds were <unknown> & the room very stuffy . Called again , they sent <unknown> to fix it , & he recommended getting a new room , because the room will not cool down . They told us they were booked , yet , after the maintenance man called , they <unknown> had a room available , go figure ? So they move us to another room , guess what , it is <unknown> degrees . Again , they told us to turn it down to 40 , <unknown> to say , it never <unknown> down & we should have just slept on the street . We travel a lot , and we stayed here one night , and it was awful ! ! . At check out , I had to <unknown> our entire room issue , they actually ended up not charging us for the night , thank god they did not offer us <unknown> nights stay , because we would never go back . Also , the room decor is very old and stuffy . If your going to Chicago , do n't stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker ! ! <stop>
<s> Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently . We got a room with a king size <unknown> Although the room is small , we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our <unknown> & all . However , we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable , the bed sheets kinda feel <unknown> to us . The walls are really thin and we could hear our <unknown> talking and <unknown> the <unknown> sound . 1 of the days , our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a <unknown> to us as we thought that like all hotels , rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign . The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night , we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage . The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our <unknown> . This is unacceptable to us . The hotel is in the <unknown> <unknown> and it is rather quiet at night . Although it is near the CTA <unknown> , i would <unknown> one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its <unknown> at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view . <unknown> staying again at a Kimpton hotel in <unknown> <unknown> next month and i am <unknown> if i should change ! Overall , not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again ! <stop>
<s> The Conrad Hilton recently took over this property from the failed <unknown> Hotel . It seems that the Conrad has <unknown> a hotel property that just does n't work . The entrance is very difficult to find . There are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby . As a <unknown> , there was often a line waiting for them . The same problem <unknown> the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area . If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay , you will find the poor elevator layout annoying . The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels . Although I like modern design , the room was quite stark and cold . It was also showing quite a bit of wear and <unknown> . The bathroom was the best part . <unknown> anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk ? It was the most uncomfortable set-up I 've experienced . The views are <unknown> for most of the rooms . In a city with amazing <unknown> , this was disappointing . I saw a couple walking the <unknown> with management trying to find a room that was <unknown> to them . Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay . Excellent food and high quality <unknown> . <unknown> I could n't write a better review . Would I stay here again ? No . Chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them . <stop>
<s> <unknown> you just ca n't find fault with a hotel , even if you tried . <unknown> was the case with Sofitel , where we 'd never stayed before . It 's a sleek , modern , <unknown> hotel with European touches . We spent three days there on a leisure weekend , we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building , at a total cost including taxes and <unknown> of about $ <unknown> a night . The room was average sized , well-appointed , everything in it worked , and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago <unknown> <unknown> , including <unknown> of the lake . The public areas were wonderfully decorated . The restaurant served a good breakfast at , for Chicago , reasonable prices . The staff was excellent . My wife <unknown> her <unknown> several weeks before we visited and was on <unknown> . The staff <unknown> us a <unknown> and was very helpful in <unknown> her . <stop>
<s> Our check-in was great , but then we got into our room . The carpet was <unknown> and stained near the bathroom because the shower ( open <unknown> ) <unknown> water onto the floor since there are no doors on it . The mini bar was broken and put an extremely <unknown> <unknown> into the room . Our final hotel bill <unknown> 2 charges that were incorrect ... <unknown> for the mini bar which we did not <unknown> , and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine ( $ <unknown> instead of $ 50 ) . When my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected , he was met with a very unfriendly and <unknown> employee . It was <unknown> , but not without <unknown> . There was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same `` <unknown> '' mini bar charge on her bill as well , and was trying to have it corrected . Overall , the location of the Hard Rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one , <stop>
<s> in the <unknown> city , this is a very good <unknown> rooms and <unknown> is a walking distance <unknown> <unknown> must for business <unknown> as ease with which you can <unknown> and schedule meetings here is <unknown> . Good decor and <unknown> modern <stop>
<s> The recently remodeled Affina was amazing - from the 6 choice pillow menu to the stocked `` <unknown> and refrigerator '' to the brand name bathroom <unknown> . Within walking distance to just about everything you could possibly need , the Affina is a great hotel . The staff was pleasant and seemed to enjoy their <unknown> . Having never stayed in downtown Chicago before , the Affina over and above <unknown> our expectations . Although our trip to Chicago was only for one night , we will consider staying at the Affina again for a future visit . <stop>
<s> Spent two nights at the InterContinental on a business trip . This is a tremendous , <unknown> hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago -- right on the Magnificent Mile and <unknown> convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area . My room was in the <unknown> Tower -- a <unknown> <unknown> Club which has been <unknown> at enormous expense . The effort has been <unknown> . My room was very large and well furnished , with a beautiful bathroom which <unknown> a separate shower <unknown> . It had breathtaking views down Michigan Avenue . There is a superb <unknown> centre ( with an impressive swimming pool ) beautiful bars and a good restaurant , Zest , that serves a great breakfast . There is wifi in the rooms ( $ <unknown> per day ) and tea and coffee making facilities . No <unknown> <unknown> , but there is an <unknown> board and iron . The staff is friendly and <unknown> to please . I recommend this hotel in the <unknown> possible terms . It 's expensive , but it will be difficult to find a better one in Chicago . <stop>
<s> The Hard Rock is <unknown> and <unknown> , but an absolutely fantastic hotel ... . I was in town for business and stayed here because of it 's location , but I absolutely understand why <unknown> would like it ... right on the river , cool art <unknown> building and Millenium Park is just down the street . <unknown> the room was clean , the staff was friendly , but NOT annoying and the bar was fun . I was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were <unknown> ! I 'll definitely try it again ! <stop>
<s> The room looked like a <unknown> club <unknown> cell . <unknown> paint on all walls , doors , <unknown> , not especially clean . A <unknown> bed and a long <unknown> with an iron chair . No amenities , no <unknown> touches , nothing on the walls . No room service , no gym , no concierge . The air conditioner <unknown> off and on all night . On the plus side , the bedding was nice and there was a large screen TV . Do n't waste your money . <stop>
<s> My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 days in October , 2007 . I can not <unknown> to tell you how great this place is . The service was <unknown> and the room was fantastic . <unknown> window seat to look over Chicago . It was great . The wine reception in the evening was a special treat as was the morning coffee service in the lobby . This was our first trip to Chicago and I hope not our last . I will definately stay at Hotel Monaco again when we return . We booked our room through a <unknown> convention web site . <stop>
<s> I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel . I had requested a high floor , quiet room . <unknown> request was honored . The windows are not well <unknown> , because the traffic , car <unknown> and <unknown> continued all night long . On the first night two drunk <unknown> woke us up in the hallway . The safe in our room did not work . <unknown> had locked it before our arrival . One of the pictures under the tv had been removed , leaving a <unknown> <unknown> out of the wall . The lights are so <unknown> , that is next to impossible to read . A small <unknown> with a stained <unknown> had a `` reading light '' that was about 50 <unknown> . Our room key cards did n't work , so we returned to the lobby where they <unknown> them . Upon returning to our room , they did n't work again and we <unknown> there trying over and over again until finally we <unknown> with no help from the staff . The bathroom is small and has no fan , so the <unknown> covers the <unknown> , and unless you leave the bathroom door open , it does not clear . On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room . What about a second guest . <unknown> we supposed to <unknown> a 2 inch <unknown> cookie ? ? ? ! ! ! ! On Sunday the phone <unknown> with a 7 am <unknown> call . We had not requested to be <unknown> up ! ! ! ! The concierge did not know the way to get to O'Hare by train , and gave us a longer route than was <unknown> . I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicago ... <unknown> and more spacious , more elegant and worth the money . This is definitely not worth $ 400 a month . ( By the way , I live in Washington , DC and am used to city noise . This was unacceptable ! ) <stop>
<s> If you are looking for a hotel that is truly in the best location , the Intercontinental is it -- right on the Magnificent Mile , next to the Chicago River , across from the Wrigley Building . My daughter and I stayed here for a getaway , and quickly were able to get to <unknown> Park , shopping , Navy Pier , great dining , <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> through beautiful areas along the <unknown> and Chicago River . Check-in was easy and we were treated with courtesy throughout our stay . <unknown> , one of the <unknown> , was especially helpful in finding us a unique place to eat . The room was lovely and comfortable , although our tub did n't drain well . Just a wonderful stay ! <stop>
<s> This is a great hotel ! The views are fabulous , the service it friendly and the location is superb . We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River . The only negative is that the <unknown> in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped . We booked our room for $ <unknown> a night for Memorial Day weekend . It was a steal ! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning ! <stop>
<s> If you asked me two years ago , I would have recommended the Talbott Hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked . Now , I have definitely changed my mind . While this hotel is located in a nice area of Chicago , <unknown> by great restaurants , shops and <unknown> people , it has really <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> . As noted by my reviews , I am incredibly <unknown> about customer service . If you 're in the hospitality industry , there is really no excuse for falling short in this <unknown> -- - but <unknown> , the Talbott really has . The door staff do n't say a word , the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a <unknown> other things ( which they always are ) and the staff have an air of <unknown> . <unknown> since we , the customers , are paying to stay at their <unknown> hotel . Perhaps the most annoying <unknown> of my <unknown> stay was that I had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because I waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator , which , when it arrived , was packed to the <unknown> . I get that it 's an old hotel , but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction , the other one <unknown> with people and I am forced to walk <unknown> flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time ( which I did n't . ) I will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting . <stop>
<s> I have traveled to Chicago many times for business , and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable <unknown> . There was nothing <unknown> wrong the Sheraton , but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel . It almost looked as if an <unknown> walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs . The carpets were old , there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom , towels and linens were older than I expected , the rooms were in need of some <unknown> , etc . during the week I was paying $ <unknown> per night for a room , and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price . One positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good . <unknown> of <unknown> machines with <unknown> , weights , etc . location is also quite good ( perhaps the reason for the high price ) with close <unknown> to Michigan Avenue and the river . In <unknown> , I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago . <stop>
<s> I stayed in this hotel for a week and I was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel . I was shocked and disapointed with my stay , Here are some of my <unknown> - Room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb - Breakfast service was slow and <unknown> - Hotel <unknown> shampoo ( one bottle for two people <unknown> and did not <unknown> a bottle that was less than half full ) . - We also shared a bar of soap . I was so disappointed with this hotel , I paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay . <stop>
<s> My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel , and found the hard rock had lost our reservation . I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone . The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying . It was n't until I started to <unknown> a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would <unknown> the issue . <unknown> <unknown> later she found our reservation . Our room was n't ready , we were told that it would be ready at noon ; we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty ! Room was very small . The bathroom shower , sink and floor were filthy . Room service <unknown> sit in the hallways all day . The next morning we called down to get towels , they were never brought to the room , we had to <unknown> dry . The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge <unknown> . He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect <unknown> . <stop>
<s> The hotel is almost always very helpful . This stay <unknown> me to <unknown> if I like the Palmer House . I had dirty covers for the bed . It was also the <unknown> room in the hotel I am sure . My husband and I usually come 8 times each year . He is there doing <unknown> and CTA work . We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now . Rooms have always had two chairs , desk , and usually <unknown> by 25 feet . Not this room on the 11th floor . It was only 15 <unknown> 17 <unknown> . The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time . In the past we had a bell man steal a $ 300 . pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our <unknown> <unknown> . <stop>
<s> The <unknown> is awesome . Very high class . It is expensive , but so is every hotel in Chicago . It is off from the dingy areas of our city , yet a long walk to Navy Pier , so you will need to pay for the cab . <unknown> to all the Magnificent Mile is boring as can be . I live in Chicago and the hotel is a better experience than the Mile of Navy ( <unknown> ) Pier . <stop>
<s> This is a tough one to review ... as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average ... . 2 is where it was . Here are my <unknown> and <unknown> : Room : 1 <unknown> . I had a corner suite . The room was pretty nasty actually ( <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ! ! ! ) . There was a <unknown> <unknown> noise from above . When I first got in I thought it was the person above me <unknown> and <unknown> . After an hour , I knew even if it was someone high on speed and <unknown> would not be going that strong . Well , the sound continued on for 3 days . Not that I <unknown> too much as I keep things on for white noise ... but it sure would bug others . Also , there were about 10 <unknown> <unknown> on the carpet and sofa . In addition , it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa . Also , there is a <unknown> <unknown> pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead <unknown> . I could not imagine all the <unknown> left on that thing either . <unknown> Bathroom : Nice size but not great . The <unknown> was lose ( really lose ) and the toilet would not flush right . Service : Great . Everyone I encountered did a great job making me feel welcome . Good stuff . Food : I had meetings there , so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made . It was really good ... much better than most hotels . Bar : Very cool . Good music , great service and good drinks . The scene was decent as well . Small bar , but was not cramped . So , maybe other rooms are nicer ... well hell they better be . <unknown> , if ONE room is like that ( especially a `` suite '' ) , I have to think others are like that as well . It is too bad though . The views are great and they actually have windows that open ... big <unknown> for the city in general ! <stop>
<s> Have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted . Great Bar ( <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> ) which was being upgraded at the end of March when I was last there , good food , lovely staff , large clean rooms , comfortable beds , spot on location for the Golden Mile , <unknown> 's <unknown> next door are fantastic . <unknown> any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the <unknown> must either have been very <unknown> or impossible to please . Highly recommended <stop>
<s> This is a superb hotel . The rooms are huge , including a luxurious bathroom . It is clean and service is first rate . Breakfast was excellent ( and complimentary for Hilton Honors members ) . Hotel is in a good location , and is connected to a mall , which I imagine would be a great <unknown> in the Chicago winter . Next time I go to Chicago , I will stay here for sure . <stop>
<s> We did n't stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room . <unknown> that , we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking . Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that wo n't have a car . Not a family <unknown> hotel . <unknown> tip : <unknown> walk from hotel <unknown> 's pizza is a must have ! ! <unknown> the walk . Many things in between hotel and <unknown> 's to do so you can break up the walk . <stop>
<s> staff was very courteous . desk clerk gave only one <unknown> for the free breakfast instead of two . second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day , <unknown> us to miss the free period . room was very clean , with a nice view of the river . bed was very comfortable . toilet looked like it <unknown> in a public <unknown> ( no <unknown> ; instead it had a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ) instead of a 4-star hotel . no <unknown> to store clothes . no wastebasket in the room , and there was a cover for the <unknown> , but no <unknown> . <unknown> luggage stand had a broken <unknown> . location was good , close to the river . several <unknown> eating places nearby . overall , a disappointment for a <unknown> hotel . i expected more for a <unknown> <unknown> . <stop>
<s> Just returned to <unknown> after a visit home to Chicago and I loved The James ! ! ! <unknown> stayed at the Ritz at Water Tower and the <unknown> around the corner -- both of which were great but The James was perfect . <unknown> the room through a package w/ American Express for a great deal so though the view was n't great the space , decor and location ca n't be beat . Staff was friendly , courteous and very helpful , the gym was <unknown> and though I did n't try the <unknown> service , the <unknown> looked yummy . I 've stayed in <unknown> in that area on <unknown> <unknown> over the past three years and the James is at the top my list now . If you can get a good deal , I highly recommend ! ! <stop>
<s> I stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of $ <unknown> . I was worried that I would n't get a nice room , since it was the weekend before the <unknown> and the hotel is across the street from Grant Park , so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms . I requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic , and that is exactly what I was assigned ( perhaps because I am also a <unknown> ' member ? ) . It was a beautiful room with windows on two sides , a king sized bed . The room was quiet , comfortable and immaculate . The maid even left a thank you note for the tip I had left . All the staff were helpful , polite and cheerful . I appreciated the fact that I could actually purchase a breakfast for under $ 15 ( <unknown> , coffee , and juice ) -- something not possible at a lot of big hotels , like the Hyatt I stayed at last year . <stop>
<s> Stayed for a week last month . Ca n't beat the location - close to the Magnificent Mile , <unknown> , <unknown> , Great Restaurants & <unknown> <unknown> . Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels . <unknown> the room was ok , not great . <unknown> in my opinion . Found staff to be <unknown> and not very helpful . Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less . <unknown> during the week as other guests were made to wait as well . Breakfast was the same stuff day after day . As the week went on , they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished ( <unknown> delivery I guess ) . Also , the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant . <unknown> for work ( <unknown> ) and frequently stay in hotels . <unknown> with family every year and also stay in hotels . This is <unknown> it for me ... not a <unknown> . Would come to Chicago again , but would not stay here . There are too many other options worth <unknown> . <stop>
<s> The location of the hotel is great , right on the river and Michigan Ave . <unknown> everything is within walking distance . At the price , though , and given the 4 star hotel , we expected better walls . Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors . The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear . We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone ( he clearly was n't speaking <unknown> ) , and the other neighbors up at <unknown> yelling and <unknown> when they came back drunk . We asked them to be quiet ( I should n't have expected that to work with some young <unknown> ) then called security , but they did nothing . I was completely annoyed with the noise , especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one . <unknown> you are in Chicago to party , get drunk , and not get any sleep , I would n't stay here . <stop>
<s> I stayed here 2 nights for a business conference . The food was pretty good . And they had these really good <unknown> that I could n't <unknown> . The room was very comfortable and the bed was great . But I was annoyed by many issues . First , their internet went down for a couple of hour when I was there on a break from the conference . It would n't have been big deal except I needed to do some business while it was down . Second , the internet was n't available in the conference rooms . I suppose the conference I attended would have had to pay extra for it . <unknown> , The chair in the room was too low for the desk so I was in an <unknown> <unknown> while using my computer which gave me a back <unknown> later . <unknown> , on the second night my key did n't work . So I asked for a new one which also did n't work . So I asked for another one and the same thing happened . <unknown> the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so I did n't have to go back down to the lobby a third time . Then he came back a little later to tell me I was in the wrong room , which I was n't . Finally , he came back with the right key . <unknown> , the TV had one remote control for <unknown> the channels and a different one for the <unknown> . <unknown> , they did n't have the <unknown> <unknown> . Much cheaper hotels do . If this hotel did n't cost so much money all of these things would be minor <unknown> , but I would expect more for what I paid . <stop>
<s> First of all , <unknown> charged me for an additional person per my <unknown> but when I arrived at the Hotel these <unknown> were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered . The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a <unknown> <unknown> for me stating that there was an <unknown> at the front desk . I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word ! ! I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel . When we went to leave the <unknown> would not open . We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up . They confirmed my <unknown> and then we were allowed to leave the structure . The Hotel itself is beautiful ! ! ! The bell <unknown> and doormen were just wonderful . They were more than helpful and gracious but the <unknown> staff were rude and not helpful at all ! ! ! ! <stop>
<s> The hotel is just ok . Stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends . They had a renovation going so there was no lobby , bar or anything . Just a <unknown> furnished room for 200 <unknown> . The renovation was not annoying but i think they <unknown> charge ... much less <unknown> its done . You <unknown> beat the location ! Very convenient especially if <unknown> like <unknown> nightlife ! <stop>
<s> I want to <unknown> so many people who were <unknown> in their service . 1 ) <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> Concierge . I wanted a fairly last minute reservation at <unknown> restaurant . I spoke with <unknown> on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation . 2 ) <unknown> <unknown> , Concierge , provided us <unknown> information on the <unknown> <unknown> . Our morning <unknown> ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and <unknown> provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the Monaco . 3 ) <unknown> service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4 ) Even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel . The rooms are <unknown> furnished in that <unknown> Hotel Monaco feel . <unknown> and bedding both very comfortable . The complimentary happy hour and morning <unknown> service were both very <unknown> by the hotel guests . <stop>
<s> This was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . The first time was far above our expectations for a $ <unknown> night room . The rooms are very nice , and the beds are comfortable . This time we got a great rate through <unknown> @ $ <unknown> night for a room with a view . We were aware of the $ <unknown> parking per night . The first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we could n't park they were full . We had no <unknown> where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking <unknown> . ( It was a Saturday evening ) Finally found a spot and were told that it would be $ <unknown> . This was 6 blocks from the hotel . Mind you its <unknown> outside and we have luggage to carry too . Not very good service for a <unknown> hotel . We got inside and apparently they were running a <unknown> out of <unknown> lobby , its called the <unknown> . That 's cool and all , yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room , it was n't an issue . The <unknown> <unknown> to our room were broken . The first night we were ok , but by the second night it was <unknown> hot in there , <unknown> degrees . So hot we could n't sleep . It was <unknown> . They sent up the `` engineer '' and he <unknown> that there was definately a problem and opened our window , 24 floors up . It never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night . It was 5 below that night and the window being open 8 '' did n't help . They would not put us in another room either . At checkout , Monday morning , our bill came to $ <unknown> after taxes for the room . We then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was <unknown> on for $ <unknown> . <unknown> , I got my <unknown> and went on our way . On <unknown> I was on my online <unknown> checking my account , to find that Hyatt charged me $ <unknown> and another charge of $ <unknown> ! ! ! That is almost $ 100 more than what the <unknown> from checkout say . I was <unknown> , so I called the hotel . Nothing was <unknown> by my phone call , they treated me as if $ 100 is n't but something you <unknown> with . She said give it another day or two and see if the additional <unknown> <unknown> off . That did n't <unknown> well with me , but what could I do . I waited . Its Friday now . I check on my account again and the charges <unknown> as they should have with the correct <unknown> <unknown> , and they still have `` <unknown> '' on the two incorrect <unknown> as well . They have charged me an additional $ 300 ! ! ! ! ! ! <unknown> so <unknown> ! and guess what ... Hyatt does n't care . They gave me the same [ -- ] line as they did <unknown> . <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> AND DO N'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . <stop>
<s> Great location - right on the Chicago River - away from the other <unknown> hotels - our room was good size , very clean and with a nice river view - Overall , a great staff - in particular I would like to point out <unknown> <unknown> - <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> - Concierge for their <unknown> in making this stay a <unknown> one - ( in the <unknown> of full <unknown> , we stayed here on our <unknown> - Starwood points ) <stop>
<s> This place is a <unknown> . I booked on Priceline , because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago , I got the Westin and loved it . Despite having paid for Priceline , I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend , instead . I did n't <unknown> it for a second . You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more . The location is not worth the place being old and so <unknown> . There are enough hotels near the loop ( and near a <unknown> stop if you need to move around the city <unknown> ) that you should not spend the money on the Millenium . Do not waste your time and stay here -- this is a <unknown> because of its location , but it 's not worth it . Really . <stop>
<s> Stayed here for 5 nights while visiting Chicago for the first time . The location is great , the hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very spacious with two bathrooms . The lobby is a great place to <unknown> and have a drink . Did n't eat in the restaurant but there are a few good ones nearby and we were beside The Art Institute , <unknown> <unknown> & Macys . Staff were friendly . Would recommend it as a base to tour the city . <stop>
<s> I was lucky enough to get a `` 4 star '' hotel off of Priceline for $ 70 - I was <unknown> that I got the Knickerbocker ! From check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly . The rooms are small but cozy . After reading the reviews from other guests I was somewhat <unknown> of what I would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel . I am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the `` 4 star '' rating . Yes , the rooms and bathrooms were small , but what historic hotel in a big city is n't ? The decor and quality met my expectations . The lobby and bar were very inviting . Overall , I would stay here again and again . <stop>
<s> This was a weekend trip for my friends and I . We booked a couple of rooms and asked in <unknown> for the reservations to be connected in some way . Our rooms were right next to one another as requested . As it was almost everyone 's first time to Chicago , we had to do a bit of <unknown> for a hotel . And , our choice was next to perfect . I had an amazing time during my first visit to Chicago and it was <unknown> due to this hotel . The customer service was <unknown> . Everyone was extremely nice and helpful . One of our rooms ordered late night room service and <unknown> about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm , and delicious . My friend suggested they had a <unknown> at 3 am because the food came up quickly too . In another of our rooms , housekeeping had <unknown> <unknown> a CD when <unknown> the CD <unknown> with an iPod dock . The concierge had the <unknown> CD purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store . Our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic ! Everything was <unknown> made in their kitchen too . An added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall . <unknown> , you do n't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes , a coffee , or a some other type of <unknown> . I was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation . <stop>
<s> I have n't actually stayed at this <unknown> <unknown> but am already disappointed in their customer service . I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental , but <unknown> I read some online <unknown> <unknown> The James Hotel 's `` <unknown> Monday <unknown> '' . The <unknown> <unknown> that if you buy a gift certificate from their website , the hotel will <unknown> that amount in `` James <unknown> '' that can be used toward your stay . <unknown> of the <unknown> gave an <unknown> date for these credits . My next trip to Chicago is in April , so I thought I 'd give The James a try . I travel frequently with my pet and I 've heard they have a very <unknown> <unknown> . So today I went online and <unknown> a $ <unknown> certificate . Me , having the one track mind that I do , somehow missed the part about the credits <unknown> March <unknown> , 2010 . I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my <unknown> . I said I could n't be in Chicago until April ( I 'm <unknown> on business until then ) , and asked if they could <unknown> my credits an extra month , or it not , refund my gift certificate purchase . I had only just made the purchase minutes before and had n't even <unknown> my email confirmation yet . Most <unknown> offer a 24 <unknown> <unknown> period . The girl at the front <unknown> was extremely rude to <unknown> basically saying `` too bad , it 's your problem now '' . She did n't even bother to <unknown> polite or <unknown> to be <unknown> about my situation at all . So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James , I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel , or try Hotel Monaco . I hear they have great service and are good with <unknown> too . <stop>
<s> My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white <unknown> . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one <unknown> red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an <unknown> . As we were <unknown> the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ... . never heard back . <stop>
<s> When making my reservation , I made it for one of the most <unknown> weekends during the summer Memorial Day . The staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate . The suites are very spacious , clean , cozy , and comfortable . Upon on arriving staff were friendly , willing to <unknown> expectations , and serve me with <unknown> . The <unknown> Breakfast was delicious each morning . The beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest . I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other Chicago hotels . <stop>
<s> Our first visit to Chicago and I really can not wait to go back . The hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful . <unknown> mention should go to the door staff who were <unknown> helpful . The room was clean , quiet and spacious , if only every hotel were like this . <stop>
<s> As a regular <unknown> to Chicago and a <unknown> guest at the Ambassador East , I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit . Room service has been eliminated despite the <unknown> Pump Room being located in the hotel , there was no in-room <unknown> , the carpet was <unknown> and stained , no phone book , the <unknown> and honor bar had been removed , and the room was so small I had to turn <unknown> to get past the bed and the <unknown> . I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms , and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms - which is <unknown> , as there are several larger room types . He did n't even offer to check <unknown> of other rooms ! In talking with the consierge , she <unknown> everything on upcoming renovations - which the hotel has been <unknown> for more than two years . All in all , a very disappointing , and expensive , experience . <stop>
<s> <unknown> there for business and the Hard Rock Hotel on Wacker <unknown> was recommended . I was to meet my <unknown> there who had arrived 1 hour before me . When she go there at <unknown> , the room was n't ready , the phone did n't work , the shower did n't work . When I got there she was already very upset . I called the manager to complain , but was put on hold for 30 min . I could hear everything in the room next to me as if there was n't any wall <unknown> us . I asked for a wake up call , but nobody called me the next morning . When I called to complain the next day , the told me the phone system was down . <unknown> room service and got the wrong order ... The building is very old and the elevator <unknown> like it is on its last <unknown> ... I would not recommend it to anyone <unknown> <stop>
<s> Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco . We have stayed many times elsewhere , <unknown> in <unknown> DC and are <unknown> to great customer service , beverages like water or soda at the wine bar , coffee and <unknown> in the morning , help with bags . Not only did the Chicago <unknown> do none of these things , the staff was not helpful , either . <unknown> were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there . <unknown> got the feeling you were `` <unknown> '' people if you asked a question . No bellman , the doorman did not open the door or help with bags . Even though we were traveling with a child , I had to request a fish when they did not bring it . Really <unknown> as we love the Monoco in Washington . <stop>
<s> Just spent three nights at the Amalfi Hotel , while in Chicago on business . Booked a <unknown> room and loved it . <unknown> room I 've ever had in a hotel in Chicago , incredibly comfortable , very clean . The breakfast and evening <unknown> were a nice bonus too . And the location could n't be beat . <unknown> distance to the the River , the Loop , Michigan Ave shopping and convenient to public transportation . I noticed a number of reviews <unknown> on the noise ; yes there is some street noise , and the building across the street is under construction ( the noise from that was usually between <unknown> , if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side ) but really , in downtown Chicago it 's not going to be <unknown> , if you want <unknown> stay in the <unknown> . If you want a great hotel ( at a great price ) right in the <unknown> of everything , stay at the Amalfi . <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for one night - I 'm a frequent business traveler and am very <unknown> with travel <unknown> . I checked in late ( almost <unknown> ) due to flight <unknown> from my home airport -- <unknown> . I took the shuttle to the airport ( best option in <unknown> of the over priced <unknown> ) , and it was my first time staying at the hotel . Upon arrival , I immediately noticed the entrance , which appeared very welcoming and warm to me . I checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if I 'd prefer a king or double ( <unknown> my reservation preference ) . I always take the king when I can , and the bed was fantastic ! It was suited with great <unknown> and these incredible down & <unknown> pillows named <unknown> made by The <unknown> <unknown> -- I checked the <unknown> , since I plan to buy some ! I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria , which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and <unknown> , it does stand out all on it 's own . The food is <unknown> <unknown> , and truly wonderful -- as a <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , I appreciate great food when I taste it ! The hotel service was good as well . Only <unknown> was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to <unknown> with their dinner theme <unknown> . They missed the <unknown> on relatively simply things like <unknown> <unknown> on the buffet , which tasted a bit <unknown> ' . But they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I <unknown> on the buffet . I would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view ( if you can get a room with one ) , fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet . <stop>
<s> We arrived for a weekend stay and really enjoyed the hotel . The <unknown> hour was so full of people that we could not get in . The second night we went earlier and it was very nice . The staff was very helpful and had a good <unknown> of the area . The rooms were modern and very clean . We will stay there again . <stop>
<s> Was there recently for one night for a conference . <unknown> to check-in at <unknown> ( the <unknown> check-in was 3pm ) , they said my room was n't ready , where as others coming after me were assigned rooms . Was given a <unknown> door key card and asked to <unknown> in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready . I <unknown> there until <unknown> , no call , so went out for dinner . Came back at <unknown> and asked if my room was ready . The <unknown> said of course yes and give me a key . When asked why no one called me , she just <unknown> . No , my <unknown> did not end there . I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room . Came back to the lobby , then they apologized and gave me another room . I said I was not going to <unknown> on <unknown> else again , so they sent someone with me to open the new room . For all my `` trouble '' they reduced my bill by about 40 % . It was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru . Very bad experience . <stop>
<s> Just got back from 2 days up in Chicago shopping with girlfriends . First time I have stayed at the Omni . I did so because I saw a $ <unknown> rate that included $ <unknown> of free food on Travelzoo . The three of us ( <unknown> year <unknown> ) all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a VERY comfortable pull out sofa . We had plenty of room . Food in the restaurant was great , service was outstanding from <unknown> we came into contact with , early morning delivery of free coffee , juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat , time of <unknown> , shopping areas , etc was really helpful . <unknown> I mention the outstanding location ? <unknown> the best ! We all decided that the Omni is our new favorite hotel . <stop>
<s> My boyfriend and I were <unknown> by the breathtaking view of Lake Michigan ! We are from <unknown> so the view of the city was very important to us . We had no problems at this hotel ... rooms , service , location were top notch . <stop>
<s> After reading the reviews on this hotel , I decided to book my stay for July 4th weekend here and I am glad I did , this hotel is absolutely beautiful . Our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows . I do have 1 complaint . The bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great , but other than that I loved it . I would definitely stay there again . <stop>
<s> I loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities . Great location , as it 's so close to both <unknown> and city . Chicago is such a <unknown> city , so this was a superb base . The staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient . The room was wonderful - very , very comfortable and exceptionally clean . Great chair . Great coffee . Lovely bathroom with a huge , absolutely fantastic shower . It was also extremely quiet . That , and the best bed ever , <unknown> I slept so well and since I was there for a week , that was very important to me . <unknown> <unknown> at the <unknown> Bar . I will most <unknown> be back ! <stop>
<s> We booked our stay through Priceline.com and got a great deal . We were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us . At check-in , we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of Lake Michigan . It was beautiful . The suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and <unknown> which we did n't need , but if we were staying longer , it would have been a <unknown> . This hotel is in close <unknown> with Grant Park which has the beautiful <unknown> <unknown> . We walked around the park and even saw a movie being <unknown> ... .but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it , this is n't the one . We ended up eating at the Irish <unknown> inside the hotel ( Kitty O'Shea 's ) which has great food . ( We have stayed here before and always end up eating here . ) There are a lot of attractions within a mile including the Field Museum , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> Field , and Navy Pier . They may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window . Overall , we had another wonderful stay at the Chicago Hilton . ( Our 4th stay ) The only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel ... <unknown> dollars a night is kind of ridiculous . <stop>
<s> Negative points : 1 . I guess they gave me the worst room . It 's small room with a king size bed even though I 'd requested a room with two queen beds . 2 . No roll away bed was available so I had to sleep on the floor . 3 . The tub in the bathroom would not drain . 4 . No <unknown> fan in the bathroom . <unknown> broken furniture . <unknown> point : 1 . <unknown> location . <stop>
<s> Our non-smoking room smelled very badly of stale <unknown> smoke . We were not allowed to change rooms . Also , the concierge staff was unprofessional , telling long <unknown> personal <unknown> to <unknown> guests while long <unknown> <unknown> . The location was great . Hotel is dated , but would still be a nice place to stay if it were n't for customer service issues . <stop>
<s> The Chicago Hyatt Regency <unknown> <unknown> the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation -- ie the room can not be cancelled . I recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel . The reservation <unknown> mentioned over the phone there was a <unknown> cancellation policy . However , when I tried to cancel the reservation within that <unknown> , <unknown> , the reservation <unknown> , said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room . He said that I should refer to the confirmation e-mail that <unknown> at the bottom that <unknown> is required at time of booking / <unknown> . This clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone . I told him to cancel without being charged . In response , he <unknown> to cancel and charge me for the full stay . Why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price ? The bottom line is the hotel <unknown> changed the terms of the <unknown> , and <unknown> should go back to customer service school ! <stop>
<s> The hotel is beautiful . It is an excellent location . There was a few minor issues . The hotel is clearly <unknown> toward the convention and business <unknown> . There were charges for almost everything , although I did not <unknown> any of these . Our room was a little small for the class of hotel , but not <unknown> small . Not a true complaint , but the elevators were very slow . My comparison was that we stayed in an <unknown> <unknown> hotel in a different city during our trip , and the Intercontinental 's were <unknown> <unknown> . That 's it , no more little <unknown> <unknown> . The staff was excellent , the doormen being the highlight . The hotel bar was also very nice . The hotel was <unknown> clean . I would definitely travel to this hotel again . <stop>
<s> Booked through Hotwire and <unknown> was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage . The <unknown> ' was of the <unknown> <unknown> ' of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms . You were unable to <unknown> what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night . They no longer have in-room coffee <unknown> . You either have to go down to their <unknown> dining room , or go around the corner to Starbucks or <unknown> 's . Internet access is not free ( $ <unknown> hours ) , the `` <unknown> <unknown> '' is a <unknown> ( tucked away in the corner of the <unknown> check room , Concierge services have limited hours , and the business center is open only during <unknown> hours ' which made it difficult to get work done after <unknown> hours . '' I would not stay there ever again , nor do I recommend it to anyone . I have had better stays at any Holiday Inn Express ! <stop>
<s> Stayed here for one night in June , but have stayed here before when on business in Chicago . Great location for <unknown> . In between Michigan Avenue 's Magnificent Mile and the Loop and next to the Chicago River . Rooms very spacious and clean . <unknown> has a wonderful view , as it is situated on the top of the hotel . Bar next to lobby , very busy with good atmosphere . <unknown> not fault the hotel . <unknown> it to the Westin - my previous address when in Chicago . <stop>
<s> My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience . The hotel as others have mentioned is in an <unknown> location . It 's in a quiet location , yet so close to many <unknown> that you want to go to . We upgraded to a <unknown> room which was totally worth the additional cost . It didnt have all the <unknown> furniture that the website photos have , but it was <unknown> appointed , spacious , and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet . The service was amazing . Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful , as well as knowledgeable . This was true from the doormen at the front , to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant . Both <unknown> that we <unknown> with had great suggestions , and were able to understand our style and <unknown> when <unknown> us out . The breakfast at Prime downstairs is <unknown> the best I have ever had in a hotel , this goes for the room service as well . <unknown> there was good , but not great . I mentioned almost <unknown> , as there was a situation that <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> in the hotel . It involved <unknown> and was <unknown> , as the hotel <unknown> <unknown> its use . However , <unknown> who is one of the hotel managers did an <unknown> competent job of making sure that we were satisfied , following up on <unknown> and was a true pleasure to deal with . The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was <unknown> quickly . Overall , we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits . <stop>
<s> beautiful place with European charm . No complaints , great location , ( never like parking in Chicago , though ) . It was $ 35 a night next door . Large beautiful lobby , a touch of class . Fantastic location for downtown , Navy Pier , and the great Grant Park ( Millenium Park , too ) ... Loved it . <stop>
<s> I called on December 6th , 2010 at 3 p.m. to book a room for an upcoming weekend getaway , and was taken <unknown> when the phone was picked up and promptly hung up without a word . <unknown> this might have been a simple mistake , I gave it another try . A woman <unknown> <unknown> as `` <unknown> '' answered the phone , rushed through her <unknown> , <unknown> incredibly <unknown> and annoyed that she had to answer the phone . <unknown> <unknown> a second go by after her <unknown> , she gave a <unknown> `` <unknown> ? ! '' before I could open my mouth and tell her `` Never mind . '' Never has a hotel answered my call so rudely . I 'd like to give the hotel the <unknown> of the <unknown> and <unknown> this unpleasant experience to `` <unknown> '' ; however I will not be calling back again in <unknown> to stay at this hotel during this trip . <stop>
<s> The lobby of the Homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining room ( actually more of a grade school <unknown> type set up ) . The <unknown> from the kitchen were disgusting , and indeed reminded my of that of a <unknown> kitchen ( <unknown> . <unknown> ) . The free breakfast and free dinner were not at all <unknown> . I suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were , that makes this hotel a good value . But i would not stay here again . <stop>
<s> The Omni is in a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue . Within just blocks are all types of stores , including <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> & <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , Macys , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> ... <unknown> could go on and on ! The room itself was fabulous . Comfortable , nice big flat screen <unknown> , nice sized bathroom . They charge for Wi-Fi , but we found if we <unknown> yes on <unknown> their guest program we could then go from the <unknown> screen right to our email without actually <unknown> the registration . We got this hotel for $ <unknown> through Priceline and felt it was a terrific deal ! <stop>
<s> We visited for my <unknown> birthday . We had never been to Chicago so was not sure where to stay . Found the deal on this hotel from Travelzoo . Great rate , staff was awesome , very helpful and nice , location was great . <unknown> our stay but still like <unknown> better . Great , great hotel . Would stay again . <stop>
<s> We stay at Hilton for 4 nights last <unknown> . It was a pleasant stay . We got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms , The TV was Ok , a <unknown> ' <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . The <unknown> was very friendly when we need . The room was very cleaned when we arrived , we ordered some <unknown> from room service and the pizza was Ok <unknown> main Hall is beautiful . The breakfast is charged , 20 dollars , kinda expensive . The internet access ( WiFi ) is charged , 13 <unknown> . Pros : <unknown> rate price , huge rooms , close to attractions at Loop , close to <unknown> station . Cons : <unknown> breakfast , Internet access charged . <unknown> : When leaving the building , always use the Michigan Av <unknown> . Its a great view . <stop>
<s> Booked a room online and got a great rate under $ 200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in Chicago in this nice location , 3 blocks I think from the water . Even though our rate was so cheap , the service was wonderful , the front desk were polite & cheerful , the doormen and valet were great and helpful , and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on , free of charge ! The fitness room was clean , large and provided fruit and clean towels , and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel . Location of hotel is safe , and such a beautiful area . Check the rates directly online of the hotel 's website , as it was the least expensive . We will stay here again for sure . <stop>
<s> I stay in Chicago all the time on business and had my first stay at the Chicago Hilton . I pretty much only stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at <unknown> from <unknown> all the way to <unknown> . This Hilton is not up to <unknown> . It 's clean and the front desk staff is nice , but in Chicago , The Drake , <unknown> <unknown> Suites , and even the Hilton <unknown> Inn are all superior to the Chicago Hilton ( and less expensive ) . <unknown> to other Hilton properties in Chicago , the rooms were not as well appointed , the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice , the TV was tiny , the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long , and the breakfast you get was more like a <unknown> Inn than a 4 star hotel . If you 're going to Chicago and you like Hilton brand hotels , you can do far better than this place . <stop>
<s> My wife and I brought our daughter downtown for a <unknown> `` American Girl '' <unknown> and chose the Monaco because of it 's <unknown> reviews . We arrived late and maybe that 's when they put out their <unknown> , but we felt <unknown> by the desk staff -- like we were an <unknown> . I 'll never understand this -- they 're in the hospitality business and they 're <unknown> ! ( This is getting <unknown> , but the reception desk which is <unknown> <unknown> to look like a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> needs some maintenance . The <unknown> `` <unknown> '' <unknown> are peeling off -- looks like they used <unknown> where they should have <unknown> <unknown> for <unknown> ) . When we got to our room we found the maid 's <unknown> work shoes at the foot of the bed ( <unknown> ! ) . I 'm still trying to figure out that <unknown> . There were no <unknown> -- so I 've <unknown> out <unknown> <unknown> . Also , to the disappointment of my daughter , the <unknown> goldfish was <unknown> . The <unknown> ( who apologized for the shoes ) explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed `` ... is that OK ? '' he said . I think the <unknown> response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a <unknown> <unknown> fish to make a tired <unknown> happy . On the up side , the rooms are nice and have an <unknown> <unknown> that my daughter loved ( `` I 'd like to live here ! '' she said ) . The bed is VERY comfortable -- my wife wants the same brand now . The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower -- except for the cheap <unknown> toilet paper . <unknown> on Kimpton ! How much can a decent roll cost ? The view <unknown> the river is great ( try to get one ) and my daughter loved the <unknown> wide <unknown> by the window -- she closed the curtains and was in her own `` club house '' watching the world go by from from high above the city . In short : very nice hotel -- desk staff at night could be nicer ( would n't cost anything and would have made up for the maid 's shoes ! ) <stop>
<s> I was looking for a fun , <unknown> hotel and it did n't deliver . The lobby was nice , and the rooms were mostly clean , but it really was n't special . Service time was slow for room requests , I found empty water bottles under the chair , and the a <stop>
<s> We enjoyed the Hotel Monaco . Great location for walking and beautiful rooms . The staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests . Will definitely stay there again ! <stop>
<s> Staff were friendly , room was well kept like a <unknown> Hyatt location . Hotel is huge , with two <unknown> and over <unknown> rooms . Good location , close to Michigan Ave and the subway . Parking is $ <unknown> . <unknown> ! I <unknown> on it on Priceline for $ <unknown> . <stop>
<s> We just got back from a great weekend in Chicago and have no complaints about the Palmer House . It 's very easy to get to from <unknown> ( the <unknown> line on the <unknown> train ) and then just a 2 block walk from the train station . The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help . We booked an <unknown> package deal on Expedia . We expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only $ 45 extra per night we upgraded to the <unknown> level ! Best <unknown> of the trip . We had a beautiful room with a King bed , down comforter , robes , <unknown> towels etc ... it also included a nice <unknown> breakfast each morning , all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour ! We took advantage of this every day . The location was <unknown> of shopping along State St. and to get to the Magnificent Mile was a $ 5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk ! We 'll be back to Chicago and the Palmer House ! <stop>
<s> Not worth the price , even a little bit . A week prior to <unknown> check-in , <unknown> an email for a room upgrade and <unknown> , of course , upon arrival , nobody <unknown> about it . <unknown> . After nobody was doing anything about it , I <unknown> them of this stay 's review will be posted on the <unknown> <unknown> . <unknown> , all of a <unknown> they figured out the problem and even offered an early check-in . Too little , Too late . Very small room with 2 queens instead of the `` <unknown> King '' I was supposed to have . <unknown> didnt open , TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not <unknown> . The <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests , well there was no check out feature . This <unknown> hole could n't hold a <unknown> to the <unknown> <unknown> Hard Rock ! <stop>
<s> This hotel can not be beat for location , price , & atmosphere . The location is <unknown> , at the corner of State & <unknown> . There are fantastic restaurants & bars all around , including House of Blues & <unknown> <unknown> 's . We stayed in a `` Corner King '' room . The room was amazing . Two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows . Even just being on the 5th floor , we had great views of the <unknown> area . The decor and amenities are <unknown> . The decor is very clean & simple but luxurious . The hotel is easy to miss from street level , but should n't be . The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating . Its a perfect home base if your <unknown> <unknown> around River North , State Street shopping , or <unknown> Street nightlife . Even if you 'll be on the Mag Mile , this is a short cab ride away . We 've <unknown> named this our downtown hotel of choice ! <stop>
<s> <unknown> here currently . Had <unknown> to sleep . The paper thin walls allow even the <unknown> <unknown> from your neighbor to feel like you 're right in bed with them . <unknown> n't sleep anyway because of the cheap , giant fluffy pillows . Called housekeeping , asked for any help ... was simply and <unknown> told , after my <unknown> for help , could they , would they have any ability to supply me with a reasonable pillow ? <unknown> answer before hanging up : `` We do not . '' Hyatt , may your well <unknown> service <unknown> to your <unknown> . <unknown> <stop>
<s> This small boutique hotel is tucked away in a perfect location between the Loop and the <unknown> Mile . Two blocks west of the Wrigley Building and so convenient to restaurants , etc . The staff , from doormen to desk folks are extra nice and accommodating . The delicious breakfast on each floor is <unknown> , the evening happy hour is more than generous , and the morning paper is welcome . <unknown> is so comfortable . This is our second stay , and certainly not our last . We love Chicago , and this hotel is one of the <unknown> why . <stop>
<s> The hotel is in a good location . It is very <unknown> in <unknown> . Beautiful flowers in lobby . The room service was very good . Concierge services were also very good . We were treated well . The shower water pressure was very poor . Also , at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they <unknown> it to us , which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually <unknown> . It was <unknown> taken care of after <unknown> hotel . Bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for <unknown> . read more <stop>
<s> me ( taking a <unknown> from <unknown> <unknown> ) : <unknown> ? front desk person : yes ? me : so , do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room ? front desk person : what room are you in ? me : <unknown> front desk person : oh . ... i 'm <unknown> so . <unknown> , you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the <unknown> floor . me : oh ? <unknown> ! so , we 're staying at this hotel , and there is a bar on the 29th floor , but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our <unknown> hotel room ? get bent ! we 're paying to stay here , not just drinking in your bar ! <stop>
<s> Do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room , that was supposed to be ready , with used towels and the <unknown> opened and used ? what about when they left the towel for the floor ( the foot towel ) to dry my face ? what about the slippers that , although being still in the bag , had all the <unknown> broken and left tiny <unknown> <unknown> over the way to the garbage ( all over the room , <unknown> <unknown> ) . i did n't <unknown> that would happen to me until i saw <unknown> hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an <unknown> to go to a company that has been able to <unknown> her . <unknown> on us , actually ! <stop>
<s> We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more . It 's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it 's just not worth the money . It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast . The sheets though , made us <unknown> for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things . The breakfast could really <unknown> from some <unknown> or <unknown> . Otherwise , it 's just an early morning <unknown> <unknown> of muffins , <unknown> , sweet breads , and <unknown> . There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain <unknown> , if you are into that sort of thing . Also , the windows do not open and there is a <unknown> control device in the room . The problem with it that it keeps <unknown> air all the time , <unknown> between cold and warm , right over the bed . There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale . They do have a business center where you can send <unknown> and use internet for free . The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there . One person at a time ... All and all , we will not stay there again . If we feel like luxury , we have to find some other place . But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city , maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that . At least we 'll know what we are paying for . <stop>
<s> Stay <unknown> ! After <unknown> as an <unknown> , cozy and <unknown> , if a bit tired <unknown> , the AE has been purchased by <unknown> <unknown> and taken down so many <unknown> it 's almost not <unknown> . <unknown> for the fact that the hotel is under renovation , the entrance is not <unknown> accessible , and I saw several hotel guests with <unknown> , <unknown> , etc ( including myself , <unknown> from foot <unknown> and in a <unknown> , with a <unknown> ) <unknown> with the up and down outside stairs one has to <unknown> just to get into and out of the hotel . With luggage , it 's almost impossible . This is simply <unknown> . I 've been a customer of the Ambassador East for decades -- but no more . The hallways are so dark one can barely see . The rooms are stark white , which in and of itself , is n't a particular problem , but it is <unknown> and almost <unknown> as one 's <unknown> <unknown> from the dark hallways . The furniture -- stark and <unknown> -- looks like something from an <unknown> <unknown> . The bed is comfortable -- what a <unknown> -- but only about 15 <unknown> off of the floor , a real problem if you 're at all physically <unknown> , or even <unknown> and less <unknown> than you were in your <unknown> days . The problems do n't end there . My room had a horribly uncomfortable <unknown> desk chair , and absolutely nowhere else to sit . No arm chair , no <unknown> , no <unknown> . With a foot in a <unknown> , it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably , perhaps even with my <unknown> elevated , while in the room . No way . The bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries . Not a <unknown> , a small table , a <unknown> , or a <unknown> cabinet . If you want to put a <unknown> , <unknown> cream , <unknown> ( for women ) or anything else down so that you can use them , you 're <unknown> out of luck . <unknown> requests for a small table or some sort of chair went <unknown> . A <unknown> umbrella from the front desk was broken and <unknown> , something I did n't discover until <unknown> in an expected <unknown> . I was <unknown> to throw it out , but remembered that they would charge me for it if I did n't return it , in <unknown> of its total lack of <unknown> . <unknown> -- <unknown> it . <unknown> ? For two days in a <unknown> , the <unknown> left several bottles of lotion , and no shampoo . Room service -- not available . If you want breakfast , the front desk will sell you a small , <unknown> , <unknown> grade muffin for $ <unknown> -- something you can buy in any <unknown> station for $ <unknown> . No added value whatsoever . The photos show a nice entrance , and a large lobby for which the AE has long been <unknown> . Unfortunately , that lobby is closed off , under construction , and the <unknown> lobby is on the second floor , difficult , again , for <unknown> access . <unknown> coffee and water for tea were <unknown> cold , at 8 in the morning . When <unknown> with these <unknown> <unknown> , the front desk staff <unknown> <unknown> their <unknown> and said , `` <unknown> , we know , you 're not the first to tell us this stuff . '' All this shows is that <unknown> does n't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable , and that the staff is either too indifferent or too <unknown> to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right . It 's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it 's under renovation . It 's another thing <unknown> to get screwed in the bargain , particularly after booking a <unknown> pre-paid reservation . Again , <unknown> this hotel like the <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I recently stayed here for the Chicago <unknown> . This was my third stay at this hotel . I have not had any issues until this visit . After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room . While getting out of bed I was cut by a <unknown> of glass in the carpet . I must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because I found <unknown> blood on the bathroom floor <unknown> . I had not noticed it before so I was very <unknown> . We <unknown> the staff and asked that the room be <unknown> and the bathroom <unknown> . We returned to the room after <unknown> to find that the <unknown> blood was still on the floor . After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no <unknown> from the hotel . <unknown> the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed <unknown> . Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago . <stop>
<s> We recently <unknown> our <unknown> anniversary in Chicago and stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . Having looked at a <unknown> places I chose this one because of its location to Navy Pier . ( We were going on a dinner <unknown> <unknown> at Navy Pier ) The hotel is a short walk ... unless you are wearing <unknown> : ) to Navy Pier . We found out on the way home only a $ 5 cab ride : ) worth $ 20 to your <unknown> ! ! Its also only a short walk to Michigan Ave shopping ... for comfortable shoes perhaps ? ? I chose this hotel because of location , but the views are also terrific . This time we had a lake view of Navy Pier , but our previous trip we had a river and lake view . both very nice . The hotel is very nice . <unknown> restaurants , although we have n't tried them . The burger place downstairs sure smelled good though : ) We ended up at <unknown> <unknown> at Navy Pier . <unknown> ! The rooms were very spacious and CLEAN ! ! I am kind of a <unknown> ! so clean is important for my <unknown> : ) The bottom level has doors that <unknown> right out to the <unknown> , and a cool water <unknown> . : ) I obviously highly recommend this hotel : ) I <unknown> 3 <unknown> <stop>
<s> The best service ! ! ! The staff here was incredible . You never had to <unknown> a <unknown> . The room was huge as hotel rooms go . The view was <unknown> . Location great . What a great weekend . We did stop for a drink at the <unknown> Restaurant and unfortunately , it closes at 11 p.m. Too bad ! ! ! The Lobby Lounge is open later but drinks costs twice as much as the bar at the <unknown> . <stop>
<s> I already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now I 'm going to write about the location ! I like to walk . This place was close to EVERYTHING ! ! ! ! The <unknown> of Chicago ' was on during the 4th of July . Let me tell you , this was the best <unknown> ' of a city that I have ever been to . It was <unknown> and took 10 mins to walk there . I took the train in from the airport ( it was around $ <unknown> but it was a solid 45 mins but for $ <unknown> , how can you complain ? ) and it was <unknown> a 10 walk to the hotel . We pretty much walked everywhere . We walked the entire magnificent mile <unknown> . We went to the <unknown> Navy or whatever the <unknown> are called . My <unknown> bar was <unknown> for <unknown> . ' <unknown> . I love champagne . And then of course there was the John Hancock <unknown> . And lots of shopping ! <stop>
<s> Our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly did n't <unknown> our 4 nights in this lovely hotel . <unknown> tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city ! ! Our <unknown> was called <unknown> - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room ! ! All the staff were really helpful and welcoming , making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable . Would certainly recommend this hotel . <stop>
<s> We stayed at the AE for two nights for a three <unknown> `` girls weekend '' ( <unknown> , mom and daughter ) . I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any <unknown> that might interest us . Then I called the property directly and was <unknown> by a very gracious man named <unknown> . <unknown> were a bit high for the Saturday night <unknown> of our stay but when I requested the American Girl <unknown> , he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate . The American Girl package was perfect for us . My 8 year old daughter was <unknown> . They give you a <unknown> bed , a <unknown> and a travel <unknown> to keep . They have <unknown> bathrobes for girl and <unknown> ( you do n't get to keep those ) . She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a <unknown> printed menu . Our room , <unknown> , was large and clean . It had two double beds with nice linens , two chairs , a desk and a clean bathroom . The employees are all very friendly and helpful . We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not eat there . We ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd Coast . This hotel is north of Michigan Ave . But it is just a short , pleasant walk to the Mag . Mile . I would definately stay here again in Chicago . <stop>
<s> I unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the Knickerbocker Hotel ... I should have checked out on day 1 . The bathrooms were filthy dirty with <unknown> hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of <unknown> and the feeling of skin <unknown> ... I pulled the bed away from the <unknown> and watched as little <unknown> sized <unknown> bugs <unknown> over the white sheets ... bed bugs ! Which I might add the hotel are saying are flying <unknown> from the windows being left open from when the window <unknown> were there ( <unknown> I took photos to the <unknown> ) <unknown> the bed bugs ... I looked at the mattress <unknown> and pillows and found long hairs on both ... I was <unknown> at the <unknown> and would never stay again at this <unknown> . <stop>
<s> When you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport , you <unknown> not in the best of <unknown> . I , working in a upscale hotel , do <unknown> many guests checking in who this has happened to . All they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in . The desk clerk who checked me in at this property , did neither . She was short , rude , handed me my keys and walked away . I would never go back to this property due to this . <stop>
<s> I choose the Homewood Suites in <unknown> Chicago because I called them directly in <unknown> of a two bed room within walking <unknown> of the attractions of Chicago . Well , when we arrived , it was <unknown> that there was <unknown> do to one of two elevators being out of service ( which it had been since <unknown> , this was Saturday ) . <unknown> we finally got to the 6th floor to check in , I figured our relaxing time had <unknown> . Well , we got our room key and headed for <unknown> floor . Again , waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room . I put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room - <unknown> we got double booked . The family was very nice and seemed OK with their surprise <unknown> . <unknown> our <unknown> and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out . We have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed . <unknown> it to the reservation desk and explained the situation . I did get an apology and a new room . New key in hand waited AGAIN for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room . <unknown> got to our room only to find it was a king suite . We are a family of four including two full <unknown> teenage boys . There was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa . So , <unknown> annoyed now , I called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though I had specifically asked for two beds when I booked . It said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when I checked in . She went so far to but <unknown> <unknown> on my reservation paper work . The operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor . The only thing we got was a <unknown> up bed that took away half the room in the living area . Now , I paid a total of <unknown> for one night for this room . We got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal . I am pretty sure my next trip to Chicago will not <unknown> this hotel . I can tell you that we are frequent <unknown> customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future . <stop>
<s> My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience . The location <unknown> to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel . Everything is at least a <unknown> minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride . The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere . I do n't <unknown> mind people smoking but the lobby , the elevator <unknown> and any area that was public had <unknown> of people smoking and <unknown> everywhere . The <unknown> room was not very impressive either . It is accessible by walking through the business center <unknown> , <unknown> if you 're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small . There is also no hot tub and the `` spa '' is a closet with a massage table . The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the `` <unknown> promise '' phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors . The beds were super comfortable . I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for <unknown> or families you can do <unknown> better in downtown Chicago . <stop>
<s> I loved the Ambassador ! What a great hotel . It 's really beautiful , and the room was absolutely <unknown> , very classic and elegant . Everything was done really well : the staff treated me like a regular . This is a <unknown> hotel , the best place I 've stayed in a long time . My only complaint is that I wish it was on the Mile , but that 's it . <stop>
<s> The heating in our room did n't work and was n't <unknown> <unknown> numerous requests , the rooms were very small , the <unknown> in the bin <unknown> in the bin for the whole stay , the <unknown> made the bed but nothing else , when we returned home my credit card <unknown> showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having pre-paid through a travel agent , it took the hotel 2 months to <unknown> my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous <unknown> phone calls to them . <stop>
<s> Swissotel <unknown> to be a <unknown> As previous <unknown> state , <unknown> in your floor is ridiculous . On the other hand , <unknown> <unknown> it could be helpful in <unknown> <unknown> to different elevators ( but if <unknown> like to <unknown> into one elevator and leave the others free for me , why change ) ? In any case , I want to take a nice hot <unknown> and -- guess what -- they are having water problems ... <unknown> disappointed . <unknown> I do n't get bug bitten this time ( checked under the sheets ) . <unknown> , due to my company 's deal , I think I have to stay here again next year <unknown> ... but so far they are <unknown> 1 star ... . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Oh <unknown> , it must be my luck ... or rather this hotel is just run down . I had to <unknown> room <unknown> <unknown> . And that 's for a <unknown> <unknown> morning stay . My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms . They gave me the key to the 2nd room , which happened to be <unknown> . Luckily the <unknown> had their security <unknown> on , so there was n't any <unknown> moment . My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today ( just now ) I had to move because of water <unknown> ( above my room and below my room ) . <unknown> , talk about an awful hotel ( or my just awful luck ? ? ? ? Maybe it 's <unknown> since I wrote a bad review last year , and continue to write one ... but it 's the <unknown> ) . Oh , also last year may not have been bed bugs . I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I <unknown> get these <unknown> <unknown> on my <unknown> . Perhaps it is something in the sheets ... or the <unknown> ... . in any case , despite the decent staff , it is a ONE at best ( <unknown> for hotel , 1 for the still nice service -- since it 's not their fault ... . ) All I can say is ... <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> '' <unknown> <unknown> THE <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , or AT <unknown> AT THIS HOTEL ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <stop>

Room seemed spacious even though its only about 300 <unknown> <unknown> Lots of room in bathroom ; comfortable bed ; very quiet , upscale hotel . We would definitely stay here again ! <stop>
<s> I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed . The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage . Finally , my <unknown> year old <unknown> , 8 year old son , and myself gave up and <unknown> it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy <unknown> . The security <unknown> was kind enough to hold the door for me . The valet parking <unknown> looked over and then ignored us . As far as I could tell , he was just standing there doing nothing . I could n't let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking <unknown> . The attendant <unknown> to where our car was <unknown> - no short distance away . My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up . They should have been <unknown> . <unknown> <unknown> , but <unknown> issues . The pool is part of the Hilton <unknown> club . Two <unknown> are reserved for adults wanting to <unknown> swim . <unknown> , two adults can take up <unknown> of the pool while everyone else is <unknown> to the <unknown> <unknown> . This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly . In addition , the pool closes at <unknown> p.m. What pool closes at <unknown> ? We stayed for 3 nights . Not one single additional bar of soap , bottle of shampoo , or coffee <unknown> . <stop>
<s> Just back from 5 night stay at Omni and would thoroughly recommend it . Staff bent over <unknown> to <unknown> in anything , no matter how minute . Great location on magnificent mile and lots to do there both for adults and my <unknown> daughter . If i had to find a fault it would be the extra charges , taxes etc for room service , bar and restaurant , but where is cheap these days ? Would definitely recommend it , especially for families . <stop>
<s> We booked our hotel stay thru <unknown> and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds . When we got to the hotel , not only did they not have a room for us ( we pre-paid ! ) , but they said they could not <unknown> what we had requested online , they could only give us what was available . The hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after I got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us . If you book online - <unknown> ! You may not get what you paid for . They did not stand by their promise they <unknown> in each room . <stop>
